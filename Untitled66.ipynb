              "'CHAPTER 1 \\n\\n\\nHe has come! \\n\\n\\n1900 BC, Mansarovar Lake(At the foot of Mount Kailash, Tibet) \\n\\nShiva gazed at the orange sky. The clouds hovering above Mansarovar had just parted to reveal \\nthe setting sun. The brilliant giver of life was calling it a day once again. Shiva had seen a few \\nsunrises in his twenty-one years. But the sunset! He tried never to miss the sunset! On any other \\nday, Shiva would have taken in the vista — the sun and the immense lake against the magnificent \\nbackdrop of the Himalayas stretching as far backas the eye could see. But not today. \\n\\nHe squatted and perched his lithe, muscular body on the narrow ledge extending over the lake. \\nThe numerous batde-scars on his skin gleamed in the shimmering reflected light of the waters. \\nShiva remembered well his carefree childhood days. He had perfected the art of throwing \\npebbles that bounced off the surface of the lake. He still held the record in his tribe for the highest \\nnumber of bounces: seventeen. \\n\\nOn a normal day, Shiva would have smiled at the memory from a cheerful past that had been \\noverwhelmed by the angst of the present. But today, he turned back towards his village without \\nany hint of j oy. \\n\\nBhadra was alert, guarding the main entrance. Shiva gestured with his eyes. Bhadra turned \\nbackto find his two back-up soldiers dozing against the fence. He cursed and kicked them hard. \\n\\nShiva turned back towards the lake. \\n\\nGod bless Bhadra! At least he takes some responsibility. \\n\\nShiva brought the chillum made of yak-bone to his hps and took in a deep drag. Any other day, \\nthe marijuana would have spread its munificence, dulling his troubled mind and letting him find \\nsome moments of solace. But not today. \\n\\nHe looted left, at the edge of the late where the soldiers of the strange foreign visitor were kept \\nunder guard. With the late behind them and twenty of Shiva’s own soldiers guarding them, it was \\nimpossible for them to mount any surprise attack \\n\\nThey let themselves be disarmed so easily. They aren’t like the bloodthirsty idiots in our land \\nwho are looking for any excuse to fight. \\n\\nThe foreigner’s words came flooding backto Shiva. ‘Come to our land. It lies beyond the great \\nmountains. Others call it Meluha. I call it Heaven. It is the richest and most powerful empire in \\nIndia. Indeed the richest and most powerful in the whole world. Our government has an offer for \\nimmigrants. You will be given fertile land and resources for farming. Today, your tribe, the \\nGunas, fight for survival in this rough, arid land. Meluha offers you a lifestyle beyond your \\n\\n\\n\\nwildest dreams. We ask for nothing in return. Just live in peace, pay your taxes and follow the \\nlaws of the land.’ \\n\\nShiva mused that he would certainly not be a chief in this new land. \\n\\nWould I really miss that so much? \\n\\nHis tribe would have to live by the laws of the foreigners. They would have to work every day \\nfor a living. \\n\\nThat’s better than fighting every day just to stay alive! \\n\\nShiva took another puff from his chillum. As the smoke cleared, he turned to stare at the hut in \\nthe centre of his village, right next to his own, where the foreigner had been stationed. He had \\nbeen told that he could sleep there in comfort. In fact, Shiva wanted to keep him hostage. Just in \\ncase. \\n\\nWe fight almost every month with the Pakratis just so that our village can exist next to the holy \\nlake. They are getting stronger every year, forming new alliances with new tribes. We can beat \\nthe Pakratis, but not all the mountain tribes together! By moving to Meluha, we can escape this \\npointless violence and may be live a life of comfort. What could possibly be wrong with that? \\nWhy shouldn’t we take this deal? It sounds so damn good! \\n\\nShiva took one last drag from the chillum before banging it on the rock, letting the ash slip out \\nand rose quickly from his perch. Brushing a few specks of ash from his bare chest, he wiped his \\nhands on his tiger skin skirt, rapidly striding to his village. Bhadra and his back-up stood to attention \\nas Shiva passed the gate. Shiva frowned and gestured for Bhadra to ease up. \\n\\nWhy does he keep forgetting that he has been my closestfriend since childhood? My becoming \\nthe chief hasn’t really changed anything. He doesn’t need to behave unnecessarily servile in front \\nof others. \\n\\nThe huts in Shiva’s village were luxurious compared to others in their land. A grown man could \\nactually stand upright in them. The shelter could withstand the harsh mountain winds for nearly \\nthree years before surrendering to the elements. He flung the empty chillum into his hut as he \\nstrode to the hut where the visitor lay sleeping soundly. \\n\\nEither he doesn’t realise he is a hostage. Or he genuinely believes that good behaviour begets \\ngood behaviour. \\n\\nShiva remembered what his uncle, also his Guru, used to say. ‘People do what their society \\nrewards them to do. If the society rewards trust, people will be trusting.’ \\n\\nMeluha must he a trusting society if it teaches even its soldiers to expect the best in strangers. \\n\\nShiva scratched his shaggy beard as he stared hard at the visitor. \\n\\nHe had said his name was Nandi. \\n\\nThe Meluhan’s massive proportions appeared even more enormous as he sprawled on the floor \\nin his stupor, his immense belly jiggling with every breath. Despite being obese, his skin was taut \\nand toned. His child-like face looted even more innocent asleep, with his mouth half open. \\n\\nIs this the man who will lead me to my destiny? Do I really have the destiny my uncle spoke \\nof? \\n\\n‘Your destiny is much larger than these massive mountains. But to mate it come true, you will \\nhave to cross these very same massive mountains.’ \\n\\nDo I deserve a good destiny ? My people come first. Will they be happy in Meluha? \\n\\nShiva continued to stare at the sleeping Nandi. Then he heard the sound of a conch shell. \\n\\n\\n\\nPakratis! \\n\\n‘POSITIONS!’ screamed Shiva, as he drew his sword. \\n\\nNandi was up in an instant, drawing a hidden sword from his fur coat kept to the side. They \\nsprinted to the village gates. Following standard protocol, the women started rushing to the village \\ncentre, carrying their children along. The men ran the other way, swords drawn. \\n\\n‘Bhadra! Our soldiers at the lake! ’ shouted Shiva as he reached the entrance. \\n\\nBhadra relayed the orders and the Guna soldiers obeyed instantly. They were surprised to see \\nthe Meluhans draw weapons hidden in their coats and rush to the village. The Pakratis were upon \\nthem within moments. \\n\\nIt was a well-planned ambush by the Pakratis. Dusk was usually a time when the Guna soldiers \\ntook time to thank their gods for a day without battle. The women did their chores by the lakeside. \\nIf there was a time of weakness for the formidable Gunas, a time when they weren’t a fearsome \\nmartial clan, but just another mountain tribe trying to survive in a tough, hostile land, this was it. \\n\\nBut fate was against the Pakratis yet again. Thanks to the foreign presence, Shiva had ordered \\nthe Gunas to remain alert. Thus they were forewarned and the Pakratis lost the element of \\nsurprise. The presence of the Meluhans was also decisive, turning the tide of the short, brutal \\nbattle in favour of the Gunas. The Pakratis had to retreat. \\n\\nBloodied and scarred, Shiva surveyed the damage at the end of the battle. Two Guna soldiers \\nhad succumbed to their injuries. They would be honoured as clan heroes. But even worse, the \\nwarning had come too late for at least ten Guna women and children. Their mutilated bodies \\nwere found next to the late. The losses were high. \\n\\nBastards They kill women and children when they can’t beat us! \\n\\nA livid Shiva called the entire tribe to the centre of the village. His mind was made. \\n\\n‘This land is fit for barbarians! We have fought pointless battles with no end in sight. You know \\nmy uncle tried to mate peace, even offering access to the late shore to the mountain tribes. But \\nthese scum mistook our desire for peace as weakness. We all know what followed! ’ \\n\\nThe Gunas, despite being used to the brutality of regular battle, were shell-shocked by the \\nviciousness of the attackon the women and children. \\n\\n‘I keep nothing secret from you. All of you know the invitation of the foreigners,’continued \\nShiva, pointing to Nandi and the Meluhans. ‘They fought shoulder-to-shoulder with us today. They \\nhave earned my trust. I want to go with them to Meluha. But this cannot be my decision alone.’ \\n\\n‘You are our chief, Shiva,’ said Bhadra. ‘Your decision is our decision. That is the tradition.’ \\n\\n‘Not this time,’said Shiva holding out his hand. ‘This will change our lives completely. I believe \\nthe change will be for the better. Anything will be better than the pointlessness of the violence we \\nface daily. I have told you what I want to do. But the choice to go or not is yours. Let the Gunas \\nspeak. This time, I follow you.’ \\n\\nThe Gunas were clear on their tradition. But the respect for Shiva was not just based on \\nconvention, but also on his character. He had led the Gunas to their greatest military victories \\nthrough his genius and sheer personal bravery. \\n\\nThey spoke in one voice. ‘Your decision is our decision.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt had been five days since Shiva had uprooted his tribe. The caravan had camped in a nookat \\nthe base of one of the great valleys dotting the route to Meluha. Shiva had organized the camp in \\nthree concentric circles. The yaks had been tied around the outermost circle, to act as an alarm in \\ncase of any intruders. The men were stationed in the intermediate ring to fight if there was a \\nbattle. And the women and children were in the innermost circle, just around the fire. Expendable \\nfirst, defenders second and the most vulnerable at the inside. \\n\\nShiva was prepared for the worst. He believed that there would be an ambush. It was only a \\nmatter of time. \\n\\nThe Pakratis should have been delighted to have access to the prime lands, as well as free \\noccupation of the lake front. But Shiva knew that Yakhya, the Pakrati chief, would not allow them \\nto leave peacefully. Yakhya would like nothing better than to become a legend by claiming that \\nhe had defeated Shiva’s Gunas and won the land for the Pakratis. It was precisely this weird tribal \\nlogic that Shiva detested. In an atmosphere life this, there was never any hope for peace. \\n\\nShiva relished the call of battle, revelled in its art. But he also knew that ultimately, the battles in \\nhis land were an exercise in futility. \\n\\nHe turned to an alert Nandi sitting some distance away. The twenty-five Meluhan soldiers \\nwere seated in an arc around a second camp circle. \\n\\nWhy did he pickthe Gunas to immigrate? Why not the Pakratis? \\n\\nShiva’s thoughts were broken as he saw a shadow move in the distance. He stared hard, but \\neverything was still. Sometimes the light played tricks in this part of the world. Shiva relaxed his \\nstance. \\n\\nAnd then he saw the shadow again. \\n\\n‘TO ARMS!’ screamed Shiva. \\n\\nThe Gunas and Meluhans drew their weapons and took up battle positions as fifty Pakratis \\ncharged in. The stupidity of rushing in without thought hit them hard as they met with a wall of \\npanicky animals. The yaks bucked and kicked uncontrollably, injuring many Pakratis before they \\ncould even begin their skirmish. A few slipped through. And weapons clashed. \\n\\nA young Pakrati, obviously a novice, charged at Shiva, swinging wildly. Shiva stepped back; \\navoiding the strike. He brought his sword backup in a smooth arc, inflicting a superficial cut on the \\nPakrati’s chest. The young warrior cursed and swung back, opening his flank That was all Shiva \\nneeded. He pushed his sword in brutally, cutting through the gut of his enemy. Almost instantly, \\nhe pulled the blade out, twisting it as he did, and left the Pakrati to a slow, painful death. Shiva \\nturned around to find a Pakrati ready to strike a Guna. He jumped high and swung from the \\nelevation slicing neatly through the Pakrati’s sword arm, severing it. \\n\\nMeanwhile Bhadra, as adept at the art of battle as Shiva, was fighting two Pakratis \\nsimultaneously, with a sword in each hand. His hump did not seem to impeded his movements as \\nhe transferred his weight easily, striking the Pakrati on his left on his throat. Leaving him to die \\n\\n\\n\\nslowly, he swung with his right hand, cutting across the face of the other soldier, gouging his eye \\nout. As the soldier fell, Bhadra brought his left sword down brutally, ending the suffering quickly \\nfor this hapless enemy. \\n\\nThe battle at the Meluhan end of camp was very different. They were exceptionally well- \\ntrained soldiers. But they were not vicious. They were following rules, avoiding killing, as far as \\npossible. \\n\\nOutnumbered and led poorly, it was but a short while before the Pakratis were beaten. Almost \\nhalf of them lay dead and the rest were on their knees, begging for mercy. \\n\\nOne of them was Yakhya, his shoulder cut deep by Nandi, debilitating the movement of his \\nsword arm. \\n\\nBhadra stood behind the Pakrati chief, his sword raised high, ready to strike. ‘Shiva, quick and \\neasy or slow and painful?’ \\n\\n‘Sir! ’ intervened Nandi, before Shiva could speak. Shiva turned towards the Meluhan. \\n\\n‘This is wrong! They are begging for mercy! Killing them is against the rules of war.’ \\n\\n‘You don’t know the Pakratis!’said Shiva. ‘They are brutal. They will keep attacking us even if \\nthere is nothing to gain. This has to end. Once and for all.’ \\n\\n‘It is already ending. You are not going to live here anymore. You will soon be in Meluha.’ \\n\\nShiva stood silent. \\n\\nNandi continued, ‘How you want to end this is up to you. More of the same or different?’ \\nBhadra looked at Shiva. Waiting. \\n\\n‘You can show the Pakratis that you are better,’said Nandi. Shiva turned towards the horizon, \\nseeing the massive mountains. \\n\\nDestiny ? Chance of a better life? \\n\\nHe turned backto Bhadra. ‘Disarm them. Tate all their provisions. Release them.’ \\n\\nEven if the Pakratis are mad enough to go backto their village, rearm and come back, we \\nwould be long gone. \\n\\nA shocked Bhadra stared at Shiva. But immediately started implementing the order. \\n\\nNandi gazed at Shiva with hope. There was but one thought that reverberated through his mind. \\n‘Shiva has the heart. He has the potential. Please, let it be him. I pray to you Lord Ram, let it be \\nhim. ’ \\n\\nShiva waited backto the young soldier he had stabbed. He lay writhing on the ground, face \\ncontorted in pain, as blood oozed slowly out of his guts. For this first time in his life, Shiva felt pity \\nfor a Pakrati. He drew his sword and ended the young soldier’s suffering. \\n\\n— A@m — \\n\\nAfter marching continuously for four weeks, the caravan of invited immigrants crested the \\nfinal mountain to reach the outskirts of Srinagar, the capital of the valley of Kashmir. Nandi had \\ntalked excitedly about the glories of his perfect land. Shiva had prepared himself to see some \\n\\n\\n\\nincredible sights, which he could not have imagined in his simple homeland. But nothing could \\nhave primed him for the sheer spectacle of what certainly was paradise. Meluha. The land oj \\npure life! \\n\\nThe mighty Jhelum river, a roaring tigress in the mountains, slowed down to the beat of a \\nlanguorous cow as she entered the valley. She caressed the heavenly land of Kashmir, \\nmeandering her way into the immense Dal Late. Further down, she broke away from the late, \\ncontinuing her journey to the sea. \\n\\nThe vast valley was covered by a lush green canvas of grass. On it was painted the \\nmasterpiece that was Kashmir. Rows upon rows of flowers arrayed all of God’s colours, their \\nbrilliance broken only by the soaring Chinar trees, offering a majestic, yet warm Kashmiri \\nwelcome. The melodious singing of the birds calmed the exhausted ears of Shiva’s tribe, \\naccustomed only to the rude howling of icy mountain winds. \\n\\n‘If this is the border province, how perfect must the rest of the country be?’whispered Shiva in \\nawe. \\n\\nThe Dal Late was the site of an ancient army camp of the Meluhans. Upon the western banks \\nof the late, by the side of the Jhelum lay the frontier town that had grown beyond its simple \\nencampments into the grand Srinagar. Literally, the ‘respected city \\n\\nSrinagar had been raised upon a massive platform of almost a hundred hectares in size. The \\nplatform built of earth, towered almost five metres high. On top of the platform were the city \\nwalls, which were another twenty metres in height and four metres thick The simplicity and \\nbrilliance of building an entire city on a platform astounded the Gunas. It was a strong protection \\nagainst enemies who would have to fight up a fort wall which was essentially solid ground. The \\nplatform served another vital purpose: it raised the ground level of the city, an extremely \\neffective strategy against the recurrent floods in this land. Inside the fort walls, the city was \\ndivided into blocks by roads laid out in a neat grid pattern. It had specially constructed market \\nareas, temples, gardens, meeting halls and everything else that would be required for \\nsophisticated urban living. All the houses looted like simple multiple-storeyed block structures \\nfrom the outside. The only way to differentiate a rich man’s house was that his block would be \\nbigger. \\n\\nIn contrast to the extravagant natural landscape of Kashmir, the city of Srinagar itself was \\npainted only in restrained greys, blues and whites. The entire city was a picture of cleanliness, \\norder and sobriety. Nearly twenty thousand souls called Srinagar their home. Now an additional \\ntwo hundred had just arrived from Mount Kailash. And their leader felt a lightness of being he \\nhadn’t experienced since that terrible day, many years ago. \\n\\nI have escaped. I can mate a new beginning. I can forget. \\n\\n— — \\n\\n\\nThe caravan travelled to the immigrant camp outside Srinagar. The camp had been built on a \\n\\n\\n\\nseparate platform on the southern side of the city. Nandi led Shiva and his tribe to the Foreigners’ \\nOffice, which was placed just outside the camp. Nandi requested Shiva to wait outside as he went \\ninto the office. He soon returned, accompanied by a young official. The official gave a practised \\nsmile and folded his hands in a formal namaste. ‘Welcome to Meluha. I am Chitraangadh. I will \\nbe your Orientation Executive. Think of me as your single point of contact for all issues whilst \\nyou are here. I believe your leader’s name is Shiva. Will he step up please?’ \\n\\nShiva took a step forward. ‘I am Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘Excellent,’said Chitraangadh. ‘Would you be so kind as to follow me to the registration desk \\nplease? You will be registered as the caretaker of your tribe. Any communication that concerns \\nthem will go through you. Since you are the designated leader, the implementation of all \\ndirectives within your tribe would be your responsibility’ \\n\\nNandi cut into Chitraangadh’s officious speech to tell Shiva, ‘Sir, if you will just excuse me, I \\nwill go to the immigrant camp quarters and arrange the temporary living arrangements for your \\ntribe.’ \\n\\nShiva noticed that Chitraangadh’s ever-beaming face had lost its smile for a fraction of a \\nsecond as Nandi interrupted his flow. But he recovered quickly and the smile returned to his face \\nonce again. Shiva turned and looted at Nandi. \\n\\n‘Of course, you may. You don’t need to take my permission, Nandi,’said Shiva. ‘But in return, \\nyou have to promise me something, my friend.’ \\n\\n‘Of course, Sir,’ replied Nandi bowing slightly. \\n\\n‘Call me Shiva. Not Sir,’ grinned Shiva. ‘I am your friend. Not your Chief.’ \\n\\nA surprised Nandi looted up, bowed again and said, ‘Yes Sir. I mean, yes, Shiva.’ \\n\\nShiva turned back to Chitraangadh, whose smile for some reason appeared more genuine now. \\nHe said, ‘Well Shiva, if you will follow me to the registration desk, we will complete the \\nformalities quickly.’ \\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nThe newly registered tribe reached the residential quarters in the immigration camp, to see \\nNandi waiting outside the main gates; he led them in. The roads of the camp were just like those \\nof Srinagar. They were laid out in a neat north-south and east-west grid. The carefully paved \\nfootpaths contrasted sharply with the dirt tracks in Shiva’s own land. He noticed something strange \\nabout the road though. \\n\\n‘Nandi, what are those differently coloured stones running through the centre of the road?’ \\nasked Shiva. \\n\\n‘They cover the underground drains, Shiva. The drains take all the waste water of the camp out. \\nIt ensures that the camp remains clean and hygienic’ \\n\\nShiva marvelled at the almost obsessively meticulous planning of the Meluhans. \\n\\nThe Gunas reached the large building that had been assigned to them. For the umpteenth time, \\n\\n\\n\\nthey thanked the wisdom of their leader in deciding to come to Meluha. The three—storeyed \\nbuilding had comfortable, separate living quarters for each family. Each room had luxurious \\nfurniture including a highly polished copper plate on the wall on which they could see their \\nreflection. The rooms had clean linen bed sheets, towels and even some clothes. Feeling the cloth, \\na bewildered Shiva asked, ‘What is this material?’ \\n\\nChitraangadh replied enthusiastically, ‘It’s cotton, Shiva. The plant is grown in our lands and \\nfashioned into the cloth that you hold.’ \\n\\nThere was a broad picture window on each wall to allow the light and the warmth of the sun. \\nNotches on each wall supported a metal rod with a controlled flame on top for lighting. Each \\nroom had an attached bathroom with a sloping floor that enabled the water to flow naturally to a \\nhole which drained it out. At the right end of each bathroom was a paved basin on the ground \\nwhich culminated in a large hole. The purpose of this contraption was a mystery to the tribe. The \\nside walls had some kind of device, which when turned, allowed water to flow through. \\n\\n‘Magic! ’ whispered Bhadra’s mother. \\n\\nBeside the main door of the building was an attached house. A doctor and her nurses walled out \\nof the house to greet Shiva. The doctor, a petite, wheat-skinned woman was dressed in a simple \\nwhite cloth tied around her waist and legs in a style the Meluhans called dhoti. A smaller white \\ncloth was tied as a blouse around her chest while another cloth called an angvastram was draped \\nover her shoulders. The centre of her forehead bore a white dot. Her head had been shaved clean \\nexcept for a knotted tuft of hair at the back, called a choti. A loose string called a janau was tied \\ndown from her left shoulder across her torso to the right side. \\n\\nNandi was genuinely starded at seeing her. With a reverential namaste, he said, ‘Lady \\nAyurvati! I didn’t expect a doctor of your stature here.’ \\n\\nAyurvati looted at Nandi with a smile and a polite namaste. ‘I strongly believe in the field-work \\nexperience programme, Captain. My team follows it strictly. However, I am terribly sorry but I \\ndidn’t recognise you. Have we met before?’ \\n\\n‘My name is Captain Nandi, my lady,’answered Nandi. We haven’t met but who doesn’t know \\nyou, the greatest doctor in the land?’ \\n\\n‘Thankyou, Captain Nandi,’said a visibly embarrassed Ayurvati. ‘But I thinkyou exaggerate. \\nThere are many far superior to me.’ Turning quickly towards Shiva, Ayurvati continued, \\n‘Welcome to Meluha. I am Ayurvati, your designated doctor. My nurses and I will be at your \\nassistance for the time that you are in these quarters.’ \\n\\nHearing no reaction from Shiva, Chitraangadh said in his most earnest voice, ‘These are just \\ntemporary quarters, Shiva. The actual houses that will be allocated to your tribe will be much \\nmore comfortable. You have to stay here only for the period of the quarantine which will not last \\nmore than seven days.’ \\n\\n‘Oh no, my friend! The quarters are more than comfortable. They are beyond anything that \\nwe could have imagined. What say Mausi?’ grinned Shiva at Bhadra’s mother, before turning \\nbackto Chitraangadh with a frown. ‘But why the quarantine?’ \\n\\nNandi cut in. ‘Shiva, the quarantine is just a precaution. We don’t have too many diseases in \\nMeluha. Sometimes, immigrants may come in with new diseases. During this seven—day period, \\nthe doctors will observe and cure you of any such ailments.’ \\n\\n‘And one of the guidelines that you have to follow to control diseases is to maintain strict \\n\\n\\n\\nhygiene standards,’ said Ayurvati. \\n\\nShiva grimaced at Nandi and whispered, ‘Hygiene standards?’ \\n\\nNandi’s forehead crinkled into an apologetic frown while his hands gently advised \\nacquiescence. He mumbled, ‘Please go along with it, Shiva. It is just one of those things that we \\nhave to do in Meluha. Lady Ayurvati is considered to be the best doctor in the land.’ \\n\\n‘If you are free right now, I can give you your instructions,’ said Ayurvati. \\n\\n‘I am free right now,’ said Shiva with a straight face. ‘But I may have to charge you later.’ \\n\\nBhadra giggled softly, while Ayurvati stared at Shiva with a blank face, clearly not amused at \\nthe pun. \\n\\n‘I don’t understand what you’re trying to say,’said Ayurvati frostily. ‘In any case, we will \\nbegin at the bathroom.’ \\n\\nAyurvati walked into the guest house, muttering under her breath, ‘These uncouth \\nimmigrants...’ \\n\\nShiva raised his eyebrows towards Bhadra, grinning impishly. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nLate in the evening, after a hearty meal, all the Gunas were served a medicinal drink in their \\nrooms. \\n\\n‘Yuck! ’ grimaced Bhadra, his face contorted. ‘This tastes like Yak’s piss!’ \\n\\n‘How do you know what yak’s piss tastes like?’laughed Shiva, as he slapped his friend hard on \\nthe back ‘Now go to your room. I need to sleep.’ \\n\\n‘Have you seen the beds? I think this is going to be the best sleep of my life! ’ \\n\\n‘I have seen the bed, dammit! ’ grinned Shiva. ‘Now I want to experience it. Get out! ’ \\n\\nBhadra left Shiva’s room, laughing loudly. He wasn’t the only one excited by the unnaturally \\nsoft beds. Their entire tribe had rushed to their rooms for what they anticipated would be the most \\ncomfortable sleep of their lives. They were in for a surprise. \\n\\n— - \\n\\nShiva tossed and turned on his bed constantly. He was wearing an orange coloured dhoti. The \\ntiger skin had been taken away to be washed — for hygienic reasons. His cotton angvastram was \\nlying on a low chair by the wall. A half lit chillum lay forlorn on the side-table. \\n\\nThis cursed bed is too soft. Impossible to sleep on! \\n\\nShiva yanked the bed sheet off the mattress, tossed it on the floor and lay down. This was a little \\n\\n\\n\\nbetter. Sleep was stealthily creeping in on him. But not as strongly as at home. He missed the \\nrough cold floor of his own hut. He missed the shrill winds of Mount Kailash, which broke through \\nthe most determined efforts to ignore them. He missed the comforting stench of his tiger skin. No \\ndoubt, his current surroundings were excessively comfortable, but they were unfamiliar and \\nalien. \\n\\nAs usual, it was his instincts which brought up the truth: \\n\\n‘It’s not the room.It’s you.’ \\n\\nIt was then that Shiva noticed that he was sweating. Despite the cool breeze, he was sweating \\nprofusely. The room appeared to be spinning lightly. He felt as if his body was being drawn out \\nof itself. His frostbitten right toe felt as if it was on fire. His battle scarred left knee seemed to be \\ngetting stretched. His tired and aching muscles felt as if a great hand was remoulding them. His \\nshoulder bone, dislocated in days past and never completely healed, appeared to be ripping the \\nmuscles aside so as to re-engineer the joint. The muscles in turn seemed to be giving way to the \\nbones to do their j ob. \\n\\nBreathing was an effort. He opened his mouth to help his lungs along. But not enough air flowed \\nin. Shiva concentrated with all his might, opened his mouth wide and sucked in as much air as he \\ncould. The curtains by the side of the window rustled as a kindly wind rushed in. With the sudden \\ngush of air, Shiva’s body relaxed just a bit. And then the battle began again. He focused and \\nwilled giant gasps of air into his hungry body. \\n\\nKnock! Knock! \\n\\nThe light tapping on the door alerted Shiva. He was disoriented for a moment. Still breathing \\nhard! His shoulder was twitching. The familiar pain was missing. He looked down at his knee. It \\ndidn’t hurt anymore. The scar had vanished. Still gasping for breath! He looted down at his toe. \\nWhole and complete now. He bent to check it. A cracking sound reverberated through the room \\nas his toe made its first movement in years. Still breathing hard! There was also an unfamiliar \\ntingling coldness in his neck Very cold. \\n\\nKnock! Knock! A little more insistent now. \\n\\nA bewildered Shiva staggered to his feet, pulled the angvastram around his neck for warmth \\nand opened the door. \\n\\nThe darkness veiled his face, but Shiva could still recognise Bhadra. He whispered in a panic \\nstricken voice, ‘Shiva, I’m sorry to disturb you so late. But my mother has suddenly got a very \\nhigh fever. What should I do?’ \\n\\nShiva instinctively touched Bhadra’s forehead. ‘You too have a fever Bhadra. Go to your room. \\nI will get the doctor.’ \\n\\nAs Shiva raced down the corridor towards the steps he encountered many more doors opening \\nwith the now familiar message. ‘Sudden fever! Help!’ \\n\\nShiva sprinted down the steps to the attached building where the doctors were housed. He \\nknocked hard on the door. Ayurvati opened it immediately, as if she was expecting him. Shiva \\nspoke calmly. ‘Ayurvati, almost my entire tribe has suddenly fallen ill. Please come fast, they \\nneed help.’ \\n\\nAyurvati touched Shiva’s forehead. You don’t have a fever?’ \\n\\nShiva shookhis head. ‘No.’ \\n\\nAyurvati frowned, clearly surprised. She turned and ordered her nurses, ‘Come on. It’s begun. \\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s go.’ \\n\\nAs Ayurvati and her nurses rushed into the building, Chitraangadh appeared out of nowhere. \\nHe asked Shiva, ‘What happened?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know. Practically everybody in my tribe suddenly fell ill.’ \\n\\n‘You too are sweating heavily ’ \\n\\n‘Don’t worry. I don’t have a fever. Look, I’m going back into the building. I want to see how my \\npeople are doing’ \\n\\nChitraangadh nodded, adding, ‘I’ll call Nandi.’ \\n\\nAs Chitraangadh sped away in search of Nandi, Shiva ran into the building. He was surprised \\nthe moment he entered. All the torches in the building had been lit. The nurses were going from \\nroom to room, methodically administering medicines and advising the scared patients on what \\nthey should do. A scribe waited along with each nurse meticulously noting the details of each \\npatient on a palm-leaf booklet. The Meluhans were clearly prepared for such an eventuality. \\nAyurvati stood at the end of the corridor, her hands on her hips. Lite a general supervising her \\nsuperbly trained and efficient troops. Shiva rushed up to her and asked, ‘What about the second \\nand third floor?’ \\n\\nAyurvati answered without turning to him. ‘Nurses have already reached all over the building. \\nI will go up to supervise once the situation on this floor has stabilised. We’ll cover all the patients in \\nthe next half hour.’ \\n\\n‘You people are incredibly efficient but I pray that everyone will be okay,’said a worried \\nShiva. \\n\\nAyurvati turned to look at Shiva. Her eyebrows were raised slightly and a hint of a smile \\nhovered on her serious face. ‘Don’t worry. We’re Meluhans. We are capable of handling any \\nsituation. Everybody will be fine.’ \\n\\n‘Is there anything I can do to help?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. Please go take a bath.’ \\n\\n‘What?!’ \\n\\n‘Please go take a bath. Right now,’ said Ayurvati as she turned back to look at her team. \\n‘Everybody, please remember that all children below the age of fifteen must be tonsured. \\nMastrak, please go up and start the secondary medicines. I’ll be there in five minutes.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my lady,’ said a young man as he hurried up the steps carrying a large cloth bag. \\n\\n‘You’re still here?’ asked Ayurvati as she noticed that Shiva hadn’t left. \\n\\nShiva spoke softly, controlling his rising anger, ‘What difference will my bathing mate? My \\npeople are in trouble. I want to help.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t have the time or the patience to argue with you. You will go take a bath right now! ’said \\nAyurvati, clearly not trying to control her rising temper. \\n\\nShiva glared at Ayurvati as he made a heroic effort to rein in the curses that wanted to leap out \\nof his mouth. His clenched fists wanted to have an argument of their own with Ayurvati. But she \\nwas a woman. \\n\\nAyurvati too glared back at Shiva. She was used to being obeyed. She was a doctor. If she told \\na patient to do something, she expected it to be done without question. But in her long years of \\nexperience she had also seen a few patients like Shiva, especially from the nobility. Such patients \\nhad to be reasoned with. Not instructed. Yet, this was a simple immigrant. Not some nobleman! \\n\\n\\n\\nControlling herself with great effort, Ayurvati said, ‘Shiva, you are sweating. If you don’t wash \\nit off, it will kill you. Please trust me. You cannot be of any help to your tribe if you are dead.’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\nChitraangadh banged loudly on the door. A bleary eyed Nandi woke up cursing. He wrenched \\nthe door open and growled, ‘This better be important!’ \\n\\n‘Come quickly. Shiva’s tribe has fallen ill.’ \\n\\n‘Already? But this is only the first night!’exclaimed Nandi. Picking up his angvastram he said, \\n‘Let’s go!’ \\n\\nThe bathroom seemed a strange place for a bath. Shiva was used to splashing about in the \\nchilly Mansarovar Lake for his bi-monthly ablutions. The bathroom felt strangely constricted. He \\nturned the magical device on the wall to increase the flow of water. He used the strange cake-like \\nsubstance that the Meluhans said was a soap to rub the body clean. Ayurvati had been very clear. \\nThe soap had to be used. He turned the water off and picked up the towel. As he rubbed himself \\nvigorously, the mystifying development he had ignored in the past few hours came flooding back. \\nHis shoulder felt better than new He looted down in awe at his knee. No pain, no scar. He stared \\nin wonder at his completely healed toe. And then he realised that it wasn’t just the injured parts, \\nbut his entire body felt new, rejuvenated and stronger than ever. His neck, though, still felt \\nintolerably cold. \\n\\nWhat the devil is going on? \\n\\nHe stepped out of the bathroom and quickly wore a new dhoti. Again, Ayurvati’s strict \\ninstructions were not to wear his old clothes which were stained by his sweat. As he was putting \\non the angvastram around his neck for some warmth, there was a knock on the door. It was \\nAyurvati. ‘Shiva, can you open the door please? I just want to checkwhether you are all right.’ \\n\\nShiva opened the door. Ayurvati stepped in and checked Shiva’s temperature; it was normal. \\nAyurvati nodded slightly and said, ‘You seem to be healthy. And your tribe is recovering quickly \\nas well. The trouble has passed.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled gratefully. ‘Thanks to the skills and efficiency of your team. I am truly sorry for \\narguing with you earlier. It was unnecessary. I know you meant well.’ \\n\\nAyurvati looted up from her palm-leaf booklet with a slight smile and a raised eyebrow. ‘Being \\npolite, are we?’ \\n\\n‘I’m not that rude, you know,’ grinned Shiva. ‘You people are just too supercilious! ’ \\n\\nAyurvati suddenly stopped listening as she stared at Shiva with a stunned look on her face. How \\nhad she not noticed it before? She had never believed in the legend. Was she going to be the first \\none to see it come true? Pointing weakly with her hands she mumbled, ‘Why have you covered \\nyour neck?’ \\n\\n‘It’s very cold for some reason. Is it something to get worried about?’asked Shiva as he pulled \\nthe angvastram off. \\n\\n\\n\\nA cry resounded loudly through the silent room as Ayurvati staggered back Her hand covered \\nher mouth in shock while the palm leaves scattered on the floor. Her knees were too weak to hold \\nher up. She collapsed with her back against the wall, never once taking her eyes off Shiva. Tears \\nbroke through her proud eyes. She kept repeating, ‘Om Brahmaye namah. Om Brahmaye \\nnamah.’ \\n\\n‘What happened? Is it serious?’ asked a worried Shiva. \\n\\nYou have come! My Lord, you have come!’ \\n\\nBefore a bewildered Shiva could react to her strange reaction, Nandi rushed in and noticed \\nAyurvati on the ground. Copious tears were flowing down her face. \\n\\n‘What happened, my lady?’ asked a startled Nandi. \\n\\nAyurvati just pointed at Shiva’s neck Nandi looted up. The neckshone an eerie iridescent blue. \\nWith a cry that sounded like that of a long caged animal just released from captivity, Nandi \\ncollapsed on his knees. ‘My Lord! You have come! The Neelkanth has come! ’ \\n\\nThe Captain bent low and brought his head down to touch the Neelkanth’s feet reverentially. \\nThe object of his adoration however, stepped back befuddled and perturbed. \\n\\n‘What the hell is going on here?’ Shiva asked agitatedly. \\n\\nHolding a hand to his freezing neck he turned around to the polished copper plate and stared in \\nstunned astonishment at the reflection of his neel kanth; his blue throat. \\n\\nChitraangadh, holding the door frame for support, sobbed like a child. ‘We’re saved! We’re \\nsaved! He has come!’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 \\n\\n\\nLand of Pure Life \\n\\n\\nChenardhwaj, the governor of Kashmir, wanted to broadcast to the entire world that the \\nNeelkanth had appeared in his capital city. Not in the other frontier towns like Takshashila, \\nKarachapa or Lothal. His Srinagar! But the bird courier had arrived almost immediately from the \\nMeluhan capital Devagiri, the abode of the gods. The orders were crystal clear. The news of the \\narrival of the Neelkanth had to be kept secret until the emperor himself had seen Shiva. \\nChenardhwaj was ordered to send Shiva along with an escort to Devagiri. Most importantly, Shiva \\nhimself was not to be told about the legend. The emperor will advise the supposed Neelkanth in \\nan appropriate manner,’ were the exact words in the message. \\n\\nChenardhwaj had the privilege of informing Shiva about the journey. Shiva though, was not in \\nthe most amenable of moods. He was utterly perplexed by the sudden devotion of every \\nMeluhan around him. Since he had been transferred to the gubernatorial residence where he lived \\nin luxury, only the most important citizens of Srinagar had access to him. \\n\\n‘My Lord, we will be escorting you to Devagiri, our capital. It is a few weeks’journey from \\nhere,’said Chenardhwaj as he struggled to bend his enormous and muscular frame lower than he \\never had. \\n\\nI’m not going till somebody tells me what is going on! What the hell is this damned legend of \\nthe Neelkanth?’ Shiva asked angrily. \\n\\n‘My Lord, please have faith in us. You will know the truth soon. The emperor himself will tell \\nyou when you reach Devagiri.’ \\n\\n‘And what about my tribe?’ \\n\\n‘They will be given lands right here in Kashmir, my Lord. All the resources that they need to \\nlead a comfortable life will be provided for.’ \\n\\n‘Are they being held hostage?’ \\n\\n‘Oh no, my Lord,’said a visibly disturbed Chenardhwaj. ‘They are your tribe, my Lord. If I \\nhad my way, they would live like nobility for the rest of their lives. But the laws cannot be broken, \\nmy Lord. Not even for you. We can only give them what had been promised. In the course of \\ntime my Lord, you can decide to change the laws you feel necessary. Then we could certainly \\naccommodate them anywhere.’ \\n\\n‘Please, my Lord,’pleaded Nandi. ‘Have faith in us. You cannot imagine how important you \\nare to Meluha. We have been waiting for a very long time for you. We need your help.’ \\n\\nPlease help me! Please! \\n\\n\\n\\nThe memory of another desperate plea from a distraught woman years ago returned to haunt \\nShiva as he was stunned into silence. \\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘Your destiny is much larger than these massive mountains.’ \\n\\nNonsense! I don’t deserve any destiny. If these people knew my guilt, they would stop this \\nbullshit instantly! \\n\\n‘I don’t know what to do, Bhadra.’ \\n\\nShiva was sitting in the royal gardens on the banks of the Dal Late while his friend sat at his \\nside, carefully filling some marijuana into a chillum. As Bhadra used the lit stick to bring the \\nchillum to life, Shiva said impatiently, ‘That’s a cue for you to speak, you fool.’ \\n\\n‘No. That’s actually a cue for me to hand you the chillum, Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘Why will you not council me?’asked Shiva in anguish. ‘We are still the same friends who \\nnever made a move without consulting each other! ’ \\n\\nBhadra smiled. ‘No we are not. You are the Chief now. The tribe lives and dies by your \\ndecisions. It cannot be corrupted by any other person’s influence. We are not like the Pakratis, \\nwhere the Chief has to listen to whoever is the loudmouth on their council. Only the chief’s \\nwisdom is supreme amongst the Gunas. That is our tradition.’ \\n\\nShiva raised his eyes in exasperation. ‘Some traditions are meant to be broken! ’ \\n\\nBhadra stayed silent. Stretching his hand, Shiva grabbed the chillum from Bhadra. He took one \\ndeep puff, letting the marijuana spread its munificence into his body. \\n\\n‘I’ve heard just one line about the legend of the Neelkanth,’said Bhadra. ‘Apparently Meluha is \\nin deep trouble and only the Neelkanth can save them.’ \\n\\n‘But I can’t seem to see any trouble out here? Everything seems perfect. If they want to see \\nreal trouble we should take them to our land! ’ \\n\\nBhadra laughed slightiy. ‘But what is it about the blue throat that mates them believe you can \\nsave them?’ \\n\\n‘Damned if I know! They are so much more advanced than us. And yet they worship me like I \\nam some god. Just because of this blessed blue throat’ \\n\\n‘I think their medicines are magical though. Have you noticed that the hump on my back has \\nreduced a litde bit?’ \\n\\n‘Yes it has! Their doctors are seriously gifted.’ \\n\\n‘You know their doctors are called Brahmins?’ \\n\\n‘Lite Ayurvati?’ asked Shiva, passing the chillum back to Bhadra. \\n\\n‘Yes. But the Brahmins don’t just cure people. They are also teachers, lawyers, priests, \\nbasically any intellectual profession.’ \\n\\n‘Talented people,’ sniffed Shiva. \\n\\n‘That’s not all,’ said Bhadra, in between a long inhalation. \\n\\n\\n\\nThey have a concept of specialisation. So in addition to the Brahmins, they have a group called \\nKshatriyas, who are the warriors and rulers. Even the women can be Kshatriyas!’ \\n\\n‘Really?They allow women into their army?’ \\n\\n‘Well, apparently there aren’t too many female Kshatriyas. But yes, they are allowed into the \\narmy.’ \\n\\n‘No wonder they are in trouble!’ \\n\\nThe friends laughed loudly at the strange ways of the Meluhans. Bhadra tookanother puff from \\nthe chillum before continuing his story. ‘And then they have Vaishyas, who are craftsmen, \\ntraders and business people and finally the Shudras who are the farmers and workers. And one \\ncaste cannot do another caste’s job.’ \\n\\n‘Hang on,’said Shiva. ‘That means that since you are a warrior, you would not be allowed to \\ntrade at the marketplace?’ \\n\\n‘Yes.’ \\n\\n‘Bloody stupid! How would you get me my marijuana? After all that is the only thing you are \\nuseful for!’ \\n\\nShiva leaned back to avoid the playful blow from Bhadra. ‘All right, all right. Tate it easy!’he \\nlaughed. Stretching out, he grabbed the chillum from Bhadra and tookanother deep drag. \\n\\nWe’re talking about everything except what we should be talking about. \\n\\nShiva became serious again. ‘But seriously, strange as they are, what should I do?’ \\n\\n‘What are you thinking of doing?’ \\n\\nShiva looted away, as if contemplating the roses in the far corner of the garden. ‘I don’t want to \\nrun away once again.’ \\n\\n‘What?’ asked Bhadra, not hearing Shiva’s tormented whisper clearly. \\n\\n‘I said,’ repeated Shiva loudly, ‘I can’t bear the guilt of running away once again.’ \\n\\n‘That wasn’t your fault...’ \\n\\n‘YES IT WAS! ’ \\n\\nBhadra fell silent. There was nothing that could be said. Covering his eyes, Shiva sighed once \\nagain. ‘Yes, it was...’ \\n\\nBhadra put his hand on his friend’s shoulder, pressing it gently, letting the terrible moment pass. \\nShiva turned his face. ‘I’m asking for advice, my friend. What should I do? If they need my help, \\nI can’t turn away from them. At the same time, how can I leave our tribe all by themselves out \\nhere? What should I do?’ \\n\\nBhadra continued to hold Shiva’s shoulder. He breathed deeply. He could think of an answer. It \\nmay have been the correct answer for Shiva, his friend. But was it the correct answer for Shiva, \\nthe leader ! \\n\\n‘You have to find that wisdom yourself, Shiva. That is the tradition.’ \\n\\n‘O the hell with you! ’ \\n\\nShiva threw the chillum backat Bhadra and stormed away. \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\nIn was only a few days later that a minor caravan consisting of Shiva, Nandi and three soldiers \\nwas scheduled to leave Srinagar. The small party would ensure that they moved quickly through \\nthe realm and reached Devagiri as soon as possible. Governor Chenardhwaj was anxious for \\nShiva to be recognised quickly by the empire as the true Neelkanth. He wanted to go down in \\nhistory as the governor who found the Lord. \\n\\nShiva had been made ‘presentable’for the emperor. His hair had been oiled and smoothened. \\nLines of expensive clothes, attractive ear-rings, necklaces and other jewellery were brought to \\nadorn his muscular frame. His fair face had been scrubbed clean with special Ayurvedic herbs to \\nremove years of dead skin & decay. A cravat had been fabricated out of cotton to cover his \\nglowing blue throat. Beads had been cleverly darned on to the cravat to make it look life the \\ntraditional necklaces that Meluhan men wore while on religious exercises. The cravat felt warm \\non his still cold throat. \\n\\n‘I will be back soon,’said Shiva as he hugged Bhadra’s mother. He was amazed that the old \\nlady’s limp was a little less noticeable. \\n\\nTheir medicines are truly magical. \\n\\nAs a morose Bhadra looted at him, Shiva whispered, ‘Tate care of the tribe. You are in charge \\ntill I come back.’ \\n\\nBhadra stepped back, starded. ‘Shiva you don’t have to that just because I am your friend.’ \\n\\n‘I have to do it, you fool. And the reason I have to do i that you are more capable than me.’ \\n\\nBhadra stepped up and embraced Shiva, lest his frie notice the tears in his eyes. ‘No Shiva, I \\nam not. Not even my dreams.’ \\n\\n‘Shut up! Listen to me carefully,’said Shiva as Bhai smiled sadly. ‘I don’t think the Gunas are at \\nany risk out here. At least not as much as we were at Mount Kailash. But e\\\\ then, if you feel you \\nneed help, ask Ayurvati. I saw her wl the tribe was ill. She showed tremendous commitment save \\nus all. She is worth trusting.’ \\n\\nBhadra nodded, hugged Shiva again and left the room. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nAyurvati knocked politely on the door. ‘May I come in, my Lord?’ \\n\\nThis was the first time she had come into his presence since that fateful moment seven days \\nback. It seemed like a lifetime to her. Though she appeared to be her confident self again, there \\nwas a slightiy different look about her. She had the appearance of someone who had been \\ntouched by the divine. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Come in Ayurvati. And please, none of this “Lord” business. I am still the same uncouth \\nimmigrant you met a few days ago.’ \\n\\n‘I am sorry about that comment, my Lord. It was wrong of me to say that and I am willing to \\naccept any punishment that you may deem fit.’ \\n\\n‘What’s wrong with you? Why should I punish you for speaking the truth? Why should this \\nbloody blue throat change anything?’ \\n\\n‘You will discover the reason, my Lord,’whispered Ayurvati with her head bowed. We have \\nwaited for centuries for you.’ \\n\\n‘Centuries?! In the name of the holy late, why? What can I do that any of you smart people \\ncan’t?’ \\n\\n‘The emperor will tell you, my Lord. Suffice it to say that from all that I have heard from your \\ntribe, if there is one person worthy of being the Neelkanth, it is you.’ \\n\\n‘Speaking of my tribe, I have told them that if they need any help, they can request you. I hope \\nthat is all right.’ \\n\\n‘It would be my honour to provide any assistance to them, my Lord.’ \\n\\nSaying this, she bent down to touch Shiva’s feet in the traditional Indian form of showing \\nrespect. Shiva had resigned himself to accepting this gesture from most Meluhans but \\nimmediately stepped backas Ayurvati bent down. \\n\\n‘What the hell are you doing, Ayurvati?’asked a horrified Shiva. You are a doctor, a giver of \\nlife. Don’t embarrass me by touching my feet.’ \\n\\nAyurvati looted up at Shiva, her eyes shining with admiration and devotion. This was certainly \\na man worthy of being the Neelkanth. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nNandi entered Shiva’s room carrying a saffron cloth with the word ‘Ram’ stamped across \\nevery inch of it. He requested Shiva to wrap it around his shoulders. As Shiva complied, Nandi \\nmuttered a quick short prayer for a safe journey to Devagiri. \\n\\n‘Our horses wait outside, my Lord. We can leave when you are ready,’ said Nandi. \\n\\n‘Nandi,’said an exasperated Shiva. ‘How many times must I tell you? My name is Shiva. I am \\nyour friend, not your Lord’ \\n\\n‘Oh no, my Lord,’gasped Nandi. ‘You are the Neelkanth. You are the Lord. How can I take \\nyour name?’ \\n\\nShiva rolled his eyes, shook his head slightiy and turned towards the door. ‘I give up! Can we \\nleave now?’ \\n\\n‘Of course, my Lord.’ \\n\\nThey stepped outside to see three mounted soldiers waiting patiently, while tethered close to \\nthem were three more horses. One each for Shiva and Nandi, while the third was assigned for \\ncarrying their provisions. The we 11-organised Meluhan Empire had rest houses and provision \\n\\n\\n\\nstores spread across all major travel routes. As long as there were enough provisions for just one \\nday, a traveller carrying Meluhan coins could comfortably keep buying fresh provisions to last a \\njourney of months. \\n\\nNandi’s horse had been tethered next to a small platform. The platform had steps leading up to \\nit from the other side. Clearly, this was convenient infrastructure for obese riders who found it a \\nlittle cumbersome to climb onto a horse. Shiva looted at Nandi’s enormous form, then at his \\nunfortunate horse and then backat Nandi. \\n\\n‘Aren’t there any laws in Meluha against cruelty to animals?’asted Shiva with the most sincere \\nof expressions. \\n\\n‘Oh yes, my Lord. Very strict laws. In Meluha ALL life is precious. In fact there are strict \\nguidelines as to when and how animals can be slaughtered and...’ \\n\\nSuddenly Nandi stopped speaking. Shiva’s joke had finally breached Nandi’s slow wit. They \\nboth burst out laughing as Shiva slapped Nandi hard on his back \\n\\n— jUBlTW - \\n\\nShiva’s entourage followed the course of the Jhelum which had resumed its thunderous roar as \\nit crashed down the lower Himalayas. Once on the magnificent flat plains, the turbulent river \\ncalmed down once again and flowed smoothly on. Smooth enough for the group to get on one of \\nthe many public transport barges to sail quickly down to the town of Brihateshpuram. \\n\\nFrom there on, they went east by a well laid and marked road through Punjab, the heart of the \\nempire’s northern reaches. Punjab literally meant the land of the five rivers. The land of the \\nIndus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Beas. The four eastern rivers aspired to grasp the grand Indus, \\nwhich flowed farthest to the west. They succeeded spectacularly, after convoluted journeys on \\nthe rich plains of Punjab. The Indus itself found comfort and succour in the enormous, all \\nembracing ocean. The mystery of the ocean’s final destination though was yet to be unravelled. \\n\\n‘What is Ram?’ enquired Shiva as he looted down at the word covering every inch of his \\nsaffron cloth. \\n\\nThe three accompanying soldiers rode at a polite distance behind Shiva and Nandi. Far enough \\nnot to overhear any conversation but close enough to move in quickly at the first sign of trouble. It \\nwas a part of their standard Meluhan service rules. \\n\\n‘Lord Ram was the emperor who established our way of life, my Lord,’replied Nandi. ‘He \\nlived around one thousand two hundred years ago. He created our systems, our rules, our \\nideologies, everything. His reign is known simply as ‘Ram Rajya’ or ‘the rule of Ram. The term \\n‘Ram Rajya’is considered to be the gold standard of how an empire must be administered, to \\ncreate a perfect life for all its citizens. Meluha is still run according to his principles. Jai Shri Ram.’ \\n\\n‘He must have been quite a man! For he truly created a paradise right here on earth.’ \\n\\nShiva did not lie when he said this. He truly believed that if there was a paradise somewhere, it \\ncouldn’t have been very different from Meluha. This was a land of abundance, of almost ethereal \\n\\n\\n\\nperfection! It was an empire ruled by clearly codified and just laws, to which every Meluhan \\nwas subordinated, including the emperor. The country supported a population of nearly eight \\nmillion, which without exception seemed well fed, healthy and wealthy. The average intellect \\nwas exceptionally high. They were a slightiy serious people, but unfailingly polite and civil. It \\nseemed to be a flawless society where everyone knew his role and played it perfectly. They \\nwere conscious, nay obsessive, about their duties. The simple truth hit Shiva: if the entire society \\nwas conscious of its duties, nobody would need to fight for their individual rights. Since \\neverybody’s rights would be automatically taken care of through someone else’s duties. Lord \\nRam was a genius! \\n\\nShiva too repeated Nandi’s cry, signifying Glory to Lord Ram. ‘Jai Shri Ram. ’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\nHaving left their horses at the government authorised crossing-house, they crossed the river \\nRavi, close to Hariyupa, or the City of Hari. Shiva lingered there admiring Hariyupa at a slight \\ndistance, while his soldiers waited just beyond his shadow, having mounted their freshly allocated \\nhorses from the crossing-house on the other side of the Ravi. Hariyupa was a much larger city \\nthan Srinagar and seemed grand from the outside. Shiva thought seriously about exploring the \\nmagnificent city but that would have meant a delay in the trip to Devagiri. Next to Hariyupa, \\nShiva saw a construction project being executed. A new platform was being erected as Hariyupa \\nhad grown too populous to accommodate everyone on its existing platform. \\n\\nHow the hell do they raise these magnificent platforms? \\n\\nShiva made a mental note to visit the construction site on his return journey. At a distance, \\nJattaa, the captain of the river crossing house, was talking to Nandi while he was about to climb \\nthe platform to mount his fresh horse. \\n\\n‘Avoid the road via Jratakgiri,’ advised Jattaa. ‘There was a terrorist attack there last night. All \\nthe Brahmins were killed and the village temple was destroyed. The terrorists escaped as usual \\nbefore any backup soldiers could arrive.’ \\n\\n‘When in Lord Agni’s name will we fight back? We should attack their country!’ snarled a \\nvisibly angry Nandi. \\n\\n‘I swear by Lord Indra, if I ever find one of these Chandravanshi terrorists, I will cut his body \\ninto minute pieces and feed it to the dogs,’ growled Jattaa, clenching his fists tight. \\n\\n‘Jattaa! We are followers of the Suryavanshis. We cannot even think of barbaric warfare such \\nas that!’ said Nandi. \\n\\n‘Do the terrorists follow the rules of war when they attackus? Don’t they kill unarmed men?’ \\n\\n‘That does not mean that we can act the same way, Captain. We are Meluhans!’said Nandi \\nshaking his head. \\n\\nJattaa did not counter Nandi. He was distracted by Shiva still waiting at a distance. ‘Is he with \\nyou?’ he asked. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Yes.’ \\n\\n‘He doesn’t wear a caste amulet. Is he a new immigrant?’ \\n\\n‘Yes.’ replied Nandi, getting uncomfortable answering questions about Shiva. \\n\\n‘And you’re going to Devagiri?’asked an increasingly suspicious Jattaa, looking harder towards \\nShiva’s throat. ‘I’ve heard some rumours coming from Srinagar...’ \\n\\nNandi interrupted Jattaa suddenly. ‘Thankyou for your help, Captain Jattaa.’ \\n\\nBefore Jattaa could act on his suspicions, Nandi quickly climbed the platform, mounted his \\nhorse and rode towards Shiva. Reaching quickly, he said, ‘We should leave, my Lord.’ \\n\\nShiva wasn’t listening. He was perplexed once again as he saw the proud Captain Jattaa on his \\nknees. Jattaa was looking directly at Shiva with his hands folded in a respectful namaste. He \\nappeared to be mumbling something very quickly. Shiva couldn’t be sure from that distance, but it \\nseemed that the Captain was crying. He shook his head and whispered, ‘Why?’ \\n\\n‘We should go, my Lord,’ repeated Nandi, a litde louder. \\n\\nShiva turned to him, nodded and kicked his horse into action. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nShiva looked to his left as he rode on the straight road, observing Nandi goading his valiant horse \\nalong. He turned around and was not surprised to see his three bodyguard soldiers riding at \\nexactly the same distance as before. Not too close, and yet, not too far. He glanced back at \\nNandi, suspicious that the jewellery Nandi wore was not merely ornamental. He wore two \\namulets on his thick right arm. The first one had some symbolic lines which Shiva could not \\nfathom. The second one appeared to have an animal etching. Probably a bull. One of his gold \\nchains had a pendant shaped like a perfectly circular sun with rays streaming outwards. The other \\npendant was a brown, elliptical seed-like object with small serrations all over it. \\n\\n‘Can you tell me the significance of your jewellery or is that also a state secret?’ teased Shiva. \\n\\n‘Of course I can, my Lord,’replied Nandi earnestly. He pointed at the first amulet that had \\nbeen tied around his massive arm with a silly gold thread. This is the amulet which represents my \\ncaste. The lines drawn on it are a symbol of the shoulders of the Parmatma, the almighty. This \\nmeans that I am a Kshatriya.’ \\n\\n‘I am sure there are clearly codified guidelines for representing the other castes as well.’ \\n\\n‘Right you are, my Lord. You are exceptionally intelligent.’ \\n\\n‘No, I am not. You people are just exceptionally predictable.’ \\n\\nNandi smiled as Shiva continued. ‘So what are they?’ \\n\\n‘What are what, my Lord?’ \\n\\n‘The symbols for the Brahmins, Vaishyas and Shudras.’ \\n\\nWell, if the lines are drawn to represent the head of the Parmatma, it would mean the wearer \\nis a Brahmin. The symbol for a Vaishya would be the lines forming a symbol of the thighs of the \\nParmatma. And the feet of the Parmatma on the amulet would make the wearer a Shudra.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Interesting,’said Shiva with a slight frown. ‘I imagine most Shudras are not too pleased about \\ntheir placement.’ \\n\\nNandi was quite surprised at Shiva’s comments. He couldn’t understand why a Shudra would \\nhave a problem with this long ordained symbol. But he kept quiet for fear of disagreeing with his \\nLord. \\n\\n‘And the other amulet?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘This second amulet depicts my chosen-tribe. Each chosen-tribe takes on jobs which fit its \\nprofile. Every Meluhan, under the advice of their parents, applies for a chosen-tribe when they \\nturn twenty—five years old. Brahmins choose from birds, while Kshatriyas apply for animals. \\nFlowers are allocated to Vaishyas while Shudras must choose amongst fishes. The Allocation \\nBoard allocates the chosen-tribe on the basis of a rigorous examination process. You must qualify \\nfor a chosen-tribe that represents both your ambitions and skills. Choose a tribe that is too mighty \\nand you will embarrass yourself throughout your life if your achievements don’t measure up to \\nthe standards of that tribe. Choose a tribe too lowly and you will not be doing justice to your own \\ntalents. My chosen-tribe is a bull. That is the animal that this amulet represents.’ \\n\\n‘And if I am not being rude, what does a bull mean in your rank of Kshatriya chosen-tribes?’ \\n\\n‘Well, it’s not as high as a lion, tiger or an elephant. But it’s not a rat or a pig either! ’ \\n\\n‘Well, as far as I am concerned, the bull can beat any lion or elephant,’ smiled Shiva. And what \\nabout the pendants on your chain?’ \\n\\n‘The brown seed is a representation of the last Mahadev, Lord Rudra. It symbolises the \\nprotection and regeneration of life. Even divine weapons cannot destroy the life it protects.’ \\n\\n‘And the Sun?’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, the sun represents the fact that I am a follower of the Suryavanshi kings — the kings \\nwho are the descendants of the Sun ’ \\n\\n‘What? The Sun came down and some queen...’ teased an incredulous Shiva. \\n\\n‘Of course not, my Lord,’laughed Nandi. ‘All it means is that we follow the solar calendar. So \\nyou could say that we are the followers of the “path of the sun”. In practical terms it denotes that \\nwe are strong and steadfast. We honour our word and keep our promises even at the cost of our \\nlives. We never break the law. We deal honourably even with those who are dishonourable. Like \\nthe Sun, we never take from anyone but always give to others. We sear our duties into our \\nconsciousness so that we may never forget them. Being a Suryavanshi means that we must \\nalways strive to be honest, brave and above all, loyal to the truth.’ \\n\\n‘A tall order! I assume that Lord Ram was a Suryavanshi king?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, of course,’replied Nandi, his chest puffed up with pride. ‘He was the Suryavanshi king. \\nJai Shri Ram.’ \\n\\n‘Jai Shri Ram,’ repeated Shiva. \\n\\n\\n— xmw — \\n\\n\\n\\nNandi and Shiva crossed the river Beas on a boat. Their three soldiers waited to cross on the \\nfollowing craft. The Beas was the last river to be crossed after which stretched the straight road \\ntowards Devagiri. Unseasonal rain the previous night had made the crossing-house captain \\nconsider cancelling the day’s crossings across the river. However the weather had been relatively \\ncalm since the morning, allowing the captain to keep the service operational. Shiva and Nandi \\nshared the boat with two other passengers as well as the boatman who rowed them across. They \\nhad traded in their existing horses at the crossing-house for fresh horses on the other side. \\n\\nThey were a short distance from the opposite bank when a sudden burst of torrential rain came \\ndown from the heavens. The winds took on a sudden ferocity. The boatman made a valiant effort \\nto row quickly across, but the boat tossed violently as it surrendered to the elements. Nandi \\nstretched to tell Shiva to stay low for safety. But he did not do it gently enough. His considerable \\nweight caused the boat to list dangerously, and he fell overboard. \\n\\nThe boatman tried to steady the boat with his rows to save the other passengers. Even as he did \\nso, he had the presence of mind to pull out his conch and blow an emergency call to the crossing- \\nhouse on the other side. The other two passengers should have jumped overboard to save Nandi \\nbut his massive build made them hesitate. They knew that if they tried to save him, they would \\nmost likely drown. \\n\\nShiva felt no such hesitation as he quickly tossed aside his angvastram, pulled off his shoes and \\ndived into the turbulent river. Shiva swam with powerful strokes and quickly reached a rapidly \\ndrowning Nandi. He had to use all of his considerable strength to pull Nandi to the surface. In spite \\nof being buoyed by the water, Nandi weighed significantiy more than what any normal man \\nwould. It was fortunate that Shiva felt stronger than ever since the first night at the Srinagar \\nimmigration camp. Shiva positioned himself behind Nandi and wrapped one arm around his \\nchest. He used his other arm to swim to the bank Nandi’s weight made it very exhausting work, \\nbut Shiva was able to tow the Meluhan captain to the shore soon as the emergency staff from the \\ncrossing-house came rapidly towards them. \\n\\nShiva helped them drag Nandi’s limp body on to the land. He was unconscious. \\n\\nThe emergency staff then began a strange procedure. One of them started pressing Nandi’s \\nchest in a quick rhythmic motion to the count of five. The moment he would stop, another \\nemergency staff would cover Nandi’s lips with his own and breathe hard into his mouth. Then \\nthey would repeat the procedure all over again. Shiva did not understand what was going on but \\ntrusted both the knowledge as well as the commitment of the Meluhan medical personnel. \\n\\nAfter several anxious moments, Nandi suddenly coughed up a considerable amount of water \\nand woke up with a start. At first he was disoriented but he quickly regained his wits and turned \\nabruptly towards Shiva, screeching, ‘My Lord, why did you jump in after me? Your life is too \\nprecious. You must never risk it for me! ’ \\n\\nA surprised Shiva supported Nandi’s back and whispered calmly, ‘You need to relax, my \\nfriend.’ \\n\\nAgreeing with Shiva, the medical staff quickly placed Nandi on a stretcher to carry him into \\nthe rest house that was attached to the crossing-house. The other boat passengers were looking at \\nShiva with increasing curiosity. They knew that the fat man was a relatively senior Suryavanshi \\nsoldier, judging by his amulets. Yet he called this fair, caste-unmarked man ‘his Lord’. Strange. \\nBut all that mattered was that the soldier was safe. They dispersed as Shiva followed the medical \\n\\n\\n\\nstaff into the rest house. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 \\n\\n\\nShe Enters His Life \\n\\nNandi lay in a semi-conscious state for several hours as the medicines administered by the \\ndoctors worked on his body. Shiva sat by his side, repeatedly changing the wet cloth on his \\nburning forehead to control the fever. Nandi kept babbling incoherently as he tossed and turned in \\nhis sleep, making Shiva’s task that much more difficult. \\n\\n‘I’ve been searching... long... so long... a hundred years... never thought I.... find Neelkanth... Jai \\nShri Ram...’ \\n\\nShiva tried to ignore Nandi’s babble as he focussed on keeping the fever down. But his ears had \\ncaught on to something. \\n\\nHe’s been searching for a hundred y ears?! \\n\\nShiva frowned. \\n\\nThe fever’s affecting his bloody brain! He doesn’t looka day older than twenty years! \\n\\n‘I’ve been searching for a hundred years...,’ continued the oblivious Nandi. ‘...I found... \\nNeelkanth...’ \\n\\nShiva stopped for a moment and stared hard at Nandi. Then shaking his head dismissively, he \\ncontinued his ministrations. \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\nShiva had been walking on a paved, signposted road along the River Beas for the better part of \\nan hour. He had left the rest house to explore the area by himself, much against a rapidly \\nrecovering Nandi’s advice. Nandi was out of danger, but they had to wait for a few days \\nnevertheless, so that the Captain could be strong enough to travel. There was not much Shiva \\ncould do at the rest house and he had begun to feel resdess. The three soldiers had tried to shadow \\nShiva, but he had angrily dismissed them. ‘Will you please stop trying to stick to me like leeches?’ \\n\\nThe rhythmic hymns sung by the gentle waters of the Beas soothed Shiva. A cool tender \\nbreeze teased his thick lock of hair. He rested his hand on the hilt of his scabbard as his mind \\nswirled with persistent questions. \\n\\n\\n\\nIs Nandi really more than a hundred years old? But that’s impossible! And what the hell do \\nthese craqy Meluhans need me for any way ? And why in the name of the holy late is my bloody \\nthroat still feeling so cold? \\n\\nLost in his thoughts, Shiva did not realise that he had strayed off the road into a clearing. Staring \\nhim in the face was the most beautiful building he had ever seen. It was built entirely with white \\nand pinkmarble. An imposing flight of stairs led up to the top of a high platform, which had been \\nadorned by pillars around its entire circumference. The ornate roof was topped by a giant \\ntriangular spire, like a giant ‘namaste’to the gods. Elaborate sculptures were carved upon every \\navailable space on the structure. \\n\\nShiva had spent many days in Meluha and all the buildings he had seen so far were functional \\nand efficient. However, this particular one was oddly flamboyant. At the entrance, a signpost \\nannounced, Temple of Lord Brahma’. The Meluhans appeared to reserve their creativity for \\nreligious places. \\n\\nThere was a small crowd of hawkers around the courtyard in the clearing. Some were selling \\nflowers, others were selling food. Still others were selling assorted items required for a puja. \\nThere was a stall where worshippers could leave their footwear as they went up to the temple. \\nShiva left his shoes there and waited up the steps. Entering the main temple, he stared at the \\ndesigns and sculptures, mesmerized by the sheer magnificence of the architecture. \\n\\n‘What are you doing here?’ \\n\\nShiva turned around to find a Pandit staring at him quizzically. His wizened face sported a \\nflowing white beard matched in length only by his silvery mane. Wearing a saffron dhoti and \\nangvastram, he had the calm, gende look of a man who had already attained nirvana, but had \\nchosen to remain on earth to fulfil some heavenly duties. Shiva realised that the Pandit was the \\nfirst truly old person that he had seen in Meluha. \\n\\n‘I am sorry. Am I not allowed in here?’ asked Shiva politely. \\n\\n‘Of course you are allowed in here. Everyone is allowed into the house of the gods.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled. Before he could respond however, the Pandit questioned once again, ‘But you \\ndon’t believe in these gods, do you?’ \\n\\nShiva’s smile disappeared as quickly as it came. \\n\\nHow the hell does he know? \\n\\nThe Pandit answered the question in Shiva’s eyes. ‘Everyone who enters this place of worship \\nlooks only at the idol of Lord Brahma. Almost nobody notices the efforts and the brilliance of the \\narchitects who built this lovely temple. You, however, have eyes only for the work of the \\narchitects. You have not yet cast even a glance upon the idol.’ \\n\\nShiva grinned apologetically. You guessed right. I don’t believe in symbolic gods. I believe that \\nthe real god exists all around us. In the flow of the river, in the rustle of the trees, in the whisper of \\nthe winds. He speaks to us all the time. All we need to do is listen. However, I apologise if I have \\ncaused some offence in not showing proper respect for your god.’ \\n\\nYou don’t need to apologise, my friend,’smiled the Pandit. There is no “your god” or “;my \\ngod”. All godliness comes from the same source. Just the manifestations are different. But I have \\na feeling that one day you will find a temple worth walking into just for prayer, not to admire its \\nbeauty.’ \\n\\n‘Really ? Which temple might that be?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘You will find it when you are ready, my friend.’ \\n\\nWhy do these Meluhans always talkin bizarre riddles? \\n\\nShiva nodded politely, his expression pretending an appreciation for the Pandit’s words that he \\ndid not truly feel. He thought it wise to flee the temple before his welcome was stretched any \\nfurther. \\n\\n‘It’s time to get back to my rest house now, Pandit/7. But I eagerly look forward to finding the \\ntemple of my destiny. It was a pleasure meeting you,’said Shiva, as he bent down to touch the \\nPandit’s feet. \\n\\nPlacing his hand on Shiva’s head, the Pandit said gently, ‘Jai Guru Vishwamitra. Jai Guru \\nVashishta. ’ \\n\\nShiva rose, turned and waited down the steps. Looking at Shiva walking away from him, \\nclearly out of earshot, the Pandit whispered with an admiring smile, for he had recognised his \\nfellow traveller in karma. ‘The pleasure was all mine, my karmasaathi’ \\n\\nShiva reached the shoe stall, out on his shoes and offered a coin for the service. The shoe- \\nkeeper politely declined. ‘Thank you Sir, but this is a service provided by the government of \\nMeluha. There is no charge for it.’ \\n\\n— Adm® - \\n\\n\\nShiva smiled. ‘Of course! You people have a system for everything. Thankyou.’ \\n\\nThe shoe-keeper smiled back ‘We are only doing our duty, Sir.’ \\n\\nShiva waited back to the temple steps. As he sat down, he breathed in deeply and let the \\ntranquil atmosphere suffuse him with its serenity. And then it happened. The moment that every \\nunrealised heart craves for. The unforgettable instant that a soul, clinging on to the purest \\nmemory of its previous life, longs for. The second, that in spite of a conspiracy of the gods, only \\na few lucky men experience. The moment when she enters his life. \\n\\nShe rode in on a chariot, guiding the horses expertly into the courtyard, while a lady \\ncompanion by her side held on to the railings. Although her black hair was tied in an understated \\nbun, a few irreverent strands danced a spellbinding kathak in the wind. Her piercingly magnetic, \\nblue eyes and bronzed skin were an invitation for jealousy from the goddesses. Her body, though \\ncovered demurely in a long angvastram, still ignited Shiva’s imagination enough to sense the \\nlovely curves which lay beneath. Her flawless face was a picture of concentration as she \\nmanoeuvred the chariot skilfully into its parking place. She dismounted the chariot with an air of \\nconfidence. It was a calm confidence which had not covered the ugly distance towards \\narrogance. Her walk was dignified. Stately enough to let a beholder know that she was detached, \\nbut not cold. Shiva stared at her like a parched piece of earth mesmerised by a passing rain cloud. \\n\\nHave mercy on me! \\n\\n‘My lady, I still feel it’s not wise to wander so far from the rest of your entourage,’said her \\ncompanion. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe answered. ‘Krittika, just because others don’t know the law, doesn’t mean that we can \\nignore it. Lord Ram clearly stated that once a year, a pious woman has to visit Lord Brahma. I \\nwill not break that law, no matter how inconvenient it is to the bodyguards! ’ \\n\\nThe lady noticed Shiva staring at her as she passed by him. Her delicate eyebrows arched into \\na surprised and annoyed frown. Shiva made a valiant attempt to tear his glance away, but \\nrealised that his eyes were no longer in his control. She continued walking up, followed by \\nKrittika. \\n\\nShe turned around at the top of the temple steps, to see the caste unmarked immigrant at a \\ndistance, still staring at her unabashedly. Before turning to walk into the main temple, she \\nmuttered to Krittika, ‘These uncouth immigrants! As if we’ll find our saviour amongst these \\nbarbarians! ’ \\n\\nIt was only when she was out of sight that Shiva could breathe again. As he desperately tried to \\ngather his wits, his overwhelmed and helpless mind took one obvious decision — there was no \\nway he was leaving the temple before getting another look at her. He sat down on the steps once \\nagain. As his breathing and heartbeat returned to normal, he finally began to notice the \\nsurroundings that had been consecrated by her recent presence. He stared once again at the road \\non the left from where she had turned in. She had ridden past the cucumber seller standing near \\nthe banyan tree. \\n\\nIncidentally, why is the cucumber seller not trying to hawk his wares? He just seems to be \\nstaring at the temple. Anyway, it is not any of my concern. \\n\\nHe followed the path that her chariot had taken as it had swerved to its left, around the fountain \\nat the centre of the courtyard. It had then taken a sharp right turn past the shepherd standing at the \\nentrance of the garden. \\n\\nIncidentally, where were this shepherd’s sheep? \\n\\nShiva continued to look down the path the chariot had taken into the parking lot. Next to the \\nchariot stood another man who had just waited into the temple complex, but had inexplicably not \\nentered the temple itself. He turned to the shepherd and appeared to nod slightly. Before Shiva \\ncould piece together the information that he had just seen, he felt her presence again. He turned \\nimmediately to see her walking down the steps, with Krittika walking silently behind. Still finding \\nthis rude, caste-unmarked, obviously foreign man staring at her, she waited up to him and asked \\nin a firm but polite voice, ‘Excuse me, is there a problem?’ \\n\\n‘No. No. There’s no problem. I just felt that I had seen you before somewhere,’replied a \\nflustered Shiva. \\n\\nThe lady was not sure how to respond to this. It was obviously a lie but there appeared to be a \\nsincere voice behind it. Before she could react, Krittika cut in rudely. ‘Is that the best line you \\ncould come up with?’ \\n\\nAs Shiva was about to retort, he was alerted by a quick movement from the cucumber seller. \\nShiva turned to see him pulling out a sword as he tossed his shawl aside. The shepherd and the \\nman next to the chariot also stood poised in traditional fighter positions with their swords drawn. \\nShiva immediately drew his sword and stretched out his left hand protectively, to pull the object \\nof his fascination behind him. She however deftly side-stepped his protective hand, reached into \\nthe folds of her angvastram and drew out her own sword. \\n\\nShiva glanced at her, surprised, and flashed her a quick, admiring smile. Her eyes flashed right \\n\\n\\n\\nback, acknowledging the unexpected yet providential partnership. \\n\\nShe whispered under her breath to Krittika, ‘Run back into the temple. Stay there till this is over.’ \\n\\nKrittika protested. ‘But my lady...’ \\n\\n‘NOW!’she ordered. \\n\\nKrittika turned and ran up the temple steps. Shiva and the lady stood back to back in a standard \\ndefensive-partner position. They covered all the directions of any possible attack The three \\nattackers charged in. Two more jumped in from behind the trees to join the other three. Shiva \\nraised his sword defensively as the shepherd came up close. Feigning a sideward movement to \\ndraw the shepherd into an aggressive attack, Shiva dropped his sword low. The shepherd should \\nhave been tempted to move in for a kill wound and in response, Shiva would have quickly raised \\nhis sword and dug it deep into the shepherd’s heart. \\n\\nThe shepherd, however, moved unexpectedly. Instead of taking advantage of Shiva’s opening, \\nhe tried to strike Shiva’s shoulder. Shiva quickly raised his right arm and swung viciously, inflicting \\na deep wound across the shepherd’s torso. As the shepherd fell back, another attacker moved in \\nfrom the right. He swung from a distance. Not too smart a move, as it would merely have \\ninflicted a surface nick Shiva stepped back to avoid the swing and brought his sword down in a \\nsmooth action to dig deep into the attacker’s thigh. Screaming in agony, this attacker too fell back \\nAs another attacker joined in the fight from the left, Shiva realised that this was indeed a very \\nstrange assault. \\n\\nThe attackers seemed to know what they were doing. They seemed to be good warriors. But \\nthey also seemed to be in a bizarre dance of avoidance. They did not appear to want to kill. \\nMerely injure. It was because they held themselves in check that they were being beaten back \\nvery easily. Shiva parried off another attack from the left and pushed his sword viciously into the \\nman’s shoulder. The man screamed in pain as Shiva pushed him off the blade with his left hand. \\nSlowly, but surely, the attackers were being worn out. They were suffering too many injuries to \\nseriously carry on the assault for long. \\n\\nSuddenly a giant of a man ran in from behind the trees carrying swords in both hands. The \\nman was cloaked in a black hooded robe from head to toe while his face was hidden by a black \\nmask, shaped exactly like a human face. The only visible parts of his body were his large \\nimpassive almond-shaped eyes and strong fleshy hands. He charged upon Shiva and the lady as \\nhe barked an order to his men. He was too large to battle with agility. But he compensated for his \\nslow pace with his unusually skilled arms. Shiva registered from the corner of his eye that the \\nother attackers were picking up the injured and withdrawing. The hooded figure was fighting a \\nbrilliant rearguard action as his men retreated. \\n\\nShiva realised that the man’s hood would impair his side vision. That was a weakness that could \\nbe exploited. Moving to the left, Shiva swung ferociously, hoping to peg him back so that the lady \\ncould finish the job from the other side. But his opponent was up to the challenge. As he stepped \\nslightly back, he deflected Shiva’s swing with a deft move of his right hand. Shiva noticed a \\nleather band on the hooded figure’s right wrist. It had a sharp symbol on it. Shiva swung his sword \\nback but the hooded figure moved aside effordessly to avoid the blow. He pushed back a brutal \\nflanking attack from the lady with his left hand. He was keeping just enough distance from Shiva \\nand the lady to defend himself while at the same time keeping them engaged in combat. \\n\\nAll of a sudden the hooded figure disengaged from the battle and stepped back He began to \\n\\n\\n\\ntread backwards as he continued to point both his swords ahead, one at Shiva and the other at the \\nlady. His men had all disappeared into the trees. As he reached a safe distance, he turned and ran \\nbehind his men. Shiva considered chasing him but almost immediately decided against it. He \\nmight just rush into an ambush. \\n\\nShiva turned to the lady warrior and inquired, ‘Are you alright?’ \\n\\n‘Yes I am,’ ‘she nodded before asking with a sombre expression. Are you injured?’ \\n\\n‘Nothing serious. I’ll survive! ’ he grinned. \\n\\nIn the meantime, Krittika came running down the temple steps and asked breathlessly, ‘My \\nlady. Are you alright?’ \\n\\n‘Yes I am,’ she answered. ‘Thanks to this foreigner here.’ \\n\\nKrittika turned to Shiva and said, ‘Thank you very much. You have helped a very important \\nwoman.’ \\n\\nShiva did not seem to be listening though. He continued to stare at Krittika’s mistress as if he \\nwere possessed. Krittika struggled to conceal a smile. \\n\\nThe noble woman averted her eyes in embarrassment, but said politely, ‘I am sorry, but I am \\nquite sure that we have not met earlier.’ \\n\\n‘No it’s not that,’said a smiling Shiva. ‘It’s just that in our society, women don’t fight. You move \\nyour sword quite well for a woman.’ \\n\\nO hell! That came out all wrong. \\n\\n‘Excuse me?’ she said, a slightly belligerent tone in her voice, clearly upset about the for-a- \\nwoman remark. You don’t fight too badly either for a barbarian.’ \\n\\n‘Not too badly?! I’m an exceptional sword fighter! Do you want to try me?’ \\n\\nO bloody hell! What am I saying? I’m not going to impress her like this! \\n\\nHer expression resumed its detached, supercilious look once again. ‘I have no interest in \\nduelling with you, foreigner.’ \\n\\n‘No. No. Don’t get me wrong. I didn’t want to duel with you. I just wanted to tell you that I am \\nquite good at sword-fighting. I am good at other things as well. And it came out all wrong. I rather \\nlike the fact that you fought for yourself. You are a very good swordsman. I mean a \\nswordswoman. In fact, you are quite a woman...,’bumbled Shiva, losing the filter of judgement, \\nexactiy at the time when he needed it the most. \\n\\nKrittika, with her head bowed, smiled at the increasingly appealing exchange. \\n\\nHer mistress, on the other hand, wanted to chastise the foreigner for his highly inappropriate \\nwords. But he had saved her life. She was bound by the Meluhan code of conduct. ‘Thankyou for \\nyour help, foreigner. I owe you my life and you will not find me ungrateful. If you ever need \\nmy help, do call on me.’ \\n\\n‘Can I call on you even if I don’t need your help?’ \\n\\nShit! What am I saying?! \\n\\nShe glared at the caste-unmarked foreigner who clearly did not know his place. With \\nsuperhuman effort, she controlled herself, nodded politely and said, ‘Namaste.’ \\n\\nWith that, the aristocratic woman turned around to leave. Krittika continued to stare at Shiva \\nwith admiring eyes. \\n\\nHowever, on seeing her mistress leaving, she too turned hurriedly to follow. \\n\\n‘At least tell me your name,’ said Shiva, walking to keep pace with her. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned around, staring even more gravely at Shiva. \\n\\n‘Look, how will I find you if I need your help?’ asked Shiva sincerely. \\n\\nFor a moment, she was out of words or a glare. The request seemed reasonable. She turned \\ntowards Krittika and nodded. \\n\\n‘You can find us at Devagiri,’ answered Krittika. ‘Askanyone in the city for Lady Sati.’ \\n\\n‘Sati...,’ said Shiva, letting the ethereal name roll over his tongue. ‘My name is Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘Namaste, Shiva. And I promise you, I will honour my word if you ever need my help,’said \\nSati as she turned and climbed into her chariot, followed by Krittika. \\n\\nExpertly turning the chariot, Sati urged her horses into a smooth trot. Without a backward look \\nshe sped away from the temple. Shiva kept staring at the disappearing profile of the chariot. Once \\nit was gone, he continued to stare at the dust with intense jealousy. It had been fortunate enough to \\nhave touched her. \\n\\nI think I’m going to like this country. \\n\\nFor the first time in the journey, Shiva actually looked forward to reaching the capital city of \\nthe Meluhans. He smiled and started towards the rest house. \\n\\nHave to get to Devagiri quickly. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 \\n\\n\\nAbode of the Gods \\n\\n\\n‘What! Who attacked you?’cried a concerned Nandi as he rushed towards Shiva to check his \\nwounds. \\n\\n‘Relax Nandi,’replied Shiva. ‘You are in worse shape than I am after your adventure in the \\nwater. It’s just a few superficial cuts. Nothing serious. The doctors have already dressed the \\nwounds. I am alright.’ \\n\\n‘I am sorry, my Lord. It’s entirely my fault. I should never have left you alone. It will never \\nhappen again. Please forgive me, my Lord.’ \\n\\nPushing Nandi gently back on to the bed, Shiva said, ‘There’s nothing to forgive, my friend. \\nHow can this be your fault? Please calm down. Getting overworked will not do your health any \\ngood.’ \\n\\nOnce Nandi had calmed down a bit, Shiva continued, ‘In any case, I don’t think they were \\ntrying to kill us. It was very strange.’ \\n\\n‘Us?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, there were two women involved.’ \\n\\n‘But who could these attackers be?’asked Nandi. Then a disturbing thought dawned on Nandi. \\n‘Did the attackers wear a pendant with a crescent moon on it?’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. ‘No. But there was this one strange man. The best swordsmen of them all. He \\nwas covered from head to toe in a hooded robe, his face veiled by a mask, the kind I’ve seen you \\npeople wear at that colour festival. What is it called?’ \\n\\n‘Holi, my Lord?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, the holi kind of mask In any case, you could only see his eyes and his hands. His only \\ndistinguishing feature was a leather bracelet with a strange symbol on it’ \\n\\n‘What symbol, my Lord?’ \\n\\nPicking up a pahn-leaf booklet and the thin charcoal writing-stick from the side table, Shiva \\ndrew the symbol. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNandi frowned. ‘That is an ancient symbol that some people used for the word Aum. But who \\nwould want to use this symbol now?’ \\n\\n‘Aum?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘My Lord, Aum is the holiest word in our religion. It is considered to be the primeval sound of \\nnature. The hymn of the universe. It was so holy that for many millennia, most people would not \\ninsult it by putting it down in written form.’ \\n\\n‘Then how did this symbol come about?’ \\n\\n‘It was devised by Lord Bharat, a great ruler who had conquered practically all of India many \\nthousands of years ago. He was a rare Chandravanshi who was worth respecting and had even \\nmarried a Suryavanshi princess with the aim of ending our perpetual war.’ \\n\\n‘Who are the Chandravanshis?\\' asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Think of them as the very antithesis of us, my Lord. They are the followers of the kings who \\nare the descendants of the moon .’ \\n\\n‘And they follow the lunar calendar?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord. They are a crooked, untrustworthy and lazy people with no rules, morals or \\nhonour. They are cowards and never attack like principled Kshatriyas. Even their kings are \\ncorrupt and selfish. The Chandravanshis are a blot on humanity! ’ \\n\\n‘But what does the Aum symbol have to do with this?’ \\n\\n‘Well, King Bharat came up with this symbol of unity between the Suryavanshis and the \\nChandravanshis. The top half in white represented the Chandravanshis. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe bottom half in red represented the Suryavanshis. \\n\\n\\n\\\\)0 \\n\\nThe part in orange coming out of the meeting of these two parts represented the common path. \\n\\n\\\\D \\n\\n\\nThe crescent moon to the right of the symbol was the existing Chandra vanshi symbol. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the sun above it was the existing Sury avanshi symbol. \\n\\n\\n\\nTo signify that this was a pact blessed by the gods. Lord Bharat got a mandate for the \\npronunciation of this symbol as the holy word Aum.’ \\n\\n‘And then what happened?’ \\n\\n‘As expected, the pact died with the good king. Once the influence of Lord Bharat was gone, the \\nChandravanshis were up to their old ways and the war began once again. The symbol was \\nforgotten. And the word Aum reverted to its original form of a word without a written \\nrepresentation.’ \\n\\n‘But the symbol on the bracelet of this hooded man was not coloured. It was all black. And the \\nparts of the symbol didn’t look like lines to me. They looked like a drawing of three serpents.’ \\n\\n\\n‘Naga!’exclaimed a shocked Nandi, before mumbling a soft prayer and touching his Rudra \\npendant for protection. \\n\\n‘Now who the bloody hell are the Nagas?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘They are cursed people, my Lord,’gasped Nandi. ‘They are born with hideous deformities \\nbecause of the sins of their previous births. Deformities like extra hands or horribly misshapen \\nfaces. But they have tremendous strength and skills. The Naga name alone strikes terror in any \\ncitizen’s heart. They are not even allowed to live in the Sapt Sindhu.’ \\n\\n‘The Sapt Sindhu?’ \\n\\n‘Our land, my Lord, the land of the seven rivers. The land of the Indus, Saraswati, Yamuna, \\nGanga, Sarayu, Brahmaputra and Narmada. This is where Lord Manu mandated that all of us, \\nSuryavanshis and Chandravanshis, live.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded as Nandi continued. ‘The city of the Nagas exists to the south of the Narmada, \\nbeyond the border of our lands. In fact, it is bad luckto even speakof them, my Lord!’ \\n\\n‘But why would a Naga attackme? Or any Meluhan for that matter?’ \\n\\nCursing under his breath, Nandi said, ‘Because of the Chandra vanshis! What levels have these \\ntwo-faced people sunk to? Using the demon Nagas in their attacks! In their hatred for us, they \\ndon’t even realise how many sins they are inviting on their own souls! ’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. During the attach it hadn’t appeared that the Naga was being used by the small \\nplatoon of soldiers. In fact, it looted to him like the Naga was the leader. \\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nIt took another week for them to reach Devagiri. The capital city of the Meluhans stood on the \\nwest bank of the Saraswati, which emerged at the confluence of the Sudej and Yamuna rivers. \\nSadly, the Saraswati’s flow was severely reduced compared to her once mighty size. But even in \\nher abbreviated state, she was still massive and awe-inspiring. Unlike many of the tempestuous \\nrivers of the Punjab, the Saraswati was achingly calm. The river seemed to sense that her days \\nwere coming to an end. Yet, she did not fight aggressively to thrust her way through and survive. \\nInstead, she unselfishly gave her all to those who came to seekher treasures. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe soaring Devagiri though, was in complete contrast to the mellow Saraswati. Lite all \\nMeluhan cities, Devagiri too was built on giant platforms, an effective protection against floods \\nand a sturdy defence against enemies. However, where Devagiri was different from other \\nMeluhan cities was in its sheer size. The city sprawled over three giant platforms, each of them \\nspreading over three hundred and fifty hectares, significantly larger than other cities. The \\nplatforms were nearly eight metres high and were bastioned with giant blocks of cut stone \\ninterspaced with bated bricks. Two of the platforms, named Tamra and Rajat, literally, bronze and \\nsilver, were for the common man, whereas the platform named Svarna ox gold was the royal \\ncitadel. The platforms were connected to each other by tall bridges, made of stones and bated \\nbricks, which rose above the flood plains below. \\n\\nAlong the periphery of each enormous platform were towering city walls, with giant spites \\nfacing outwards. There were turrets at regular intervals along the city walls from where \\napproaching enemies could be repelled. This spectacle was beyond anything that Shiva had ever \\nseen. In his mind, the construction of a city like this must truly be man’s greatest achievement. \\n\\nShiva’s entourage rode up to the drawbridge across the field of spites to the Tamra platform. \\nThe drawbridge had been reinforced with metal bars at the bottom and had roughened bated \\nbricks laid out on top so that horses and chariots would not slip. There was something about the \\nbricks he had seen across the empire that had intrigued Shiva. Turning to Nandi he asked, Are \\nthese bricks made as per some standard process?’ \\n\\n‘Yes my Lord,’ replied a surprised Nandi. All the bricks in Meluha are made as per \\nspecifications and guidelines given by the Chief Architect of the empire. But how did you guess?’ \\n\\n‘They are all exactly the same dimension.’ \\n\\nNandi beamed in pride at his empire’s efficiency and his Lord’s power of observation. The \\nplatform rose at the end of the drawbridge, with a road spiralling up to the summit in one gende \\nturn, facilitating the passage of horses and chariots. In addition, there was a broad flight of stairs \\nleading straight up the incline for pedestrians. The city walls and the platform extended steeply \\nonto the sides around this slope, making it a valley of death for any enemy foolish enough to \\nattack the platform from this area. \\n\\nThe city gates were made of a metal that Shiva had never seen before. Nandi clarified that \\nthey were made of iron, a new metal that had just been discovered. It was the strongest of all the \\nmetals but very expensive. The ore required to mate it was not easily available. At the platform \\nentry, on top of the city gates, was etched the symbol of the Suryavanshis — a bright red circular \\nsun with its rays blazing out in all directions. Below it was the motto that they lived by ‘‘Satya. \\nDharma. Maan ’: Truth. Duty. Honour. \\n\\nSeeing just this much of the city had left Shiva awestruck. However, the sight that he witnessed \\nat the top of the platform, within the city gates, was truly breathtaking both in its efficiency and \\nsimplicity. The city was divided into a grid of square blocks by the paved streets. There were \\nfootpaths on the side for pedestrians, lanes marked on the street for traffic in different directions, \\nand of course, there were covered drains running through the centre. All the buildings were \\nconstructed as standard two storied block structures made of bated bricks. On top were wooden \\nextensions for increasing the height of the building, if required. Nandi clarified to Shiva that the \\nstructure of the buildings differed internally depending on their specific requirements. All \\nwindows and doors were built strictly on the side walls of buildings, never facing the main road. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe blank walls that faced the main roads bore striking black line drawings depicting the \\ndifferent legends of the Suryavanshis, while the background was painted in the sober colours of \\ngrey, light blue, light green or white. The most common background colour though, appeared to \\nbe blue. In the Meluhan mind, blue was the holiest colour of them all. It was the colour of the sky. \\nIt was just above green, the colour of the earth, in the colour spectrum. Meluhans, who liked to \\nsee some greater design in every act of nature, thought it was marvellous that blue was above \\ngreen in the colour spectrum j ust as the sky was above the earth. \\n\\nThe most recurring illustrations on the walls were about the great emperor, Lord Ram. His \\nvictories over his enemies, his subjugation of the wicked Chandra vanshis, incidents that proved his \\nstatesmanship and wisdom, had been lovingly recreated. Lord Ram was deeply revered, and \\nmany Meluhans had come to worship him like a god. They referred to him as Vishnu, an ancient \\ntitle for the greatest of the gods meaning protector of the world & propagator of good. \\n\\nAs Shiva learned from Nandi, the city was divided into many districts consisting of four to eight \\nblocks. Each district had its own markets, commercial and residential areas, temples and \\nentertainment centres. Manufacturing or any other polluting activity was conducted in separate \\nquarters away from the districts. The efficiency and smoothness with which Devagiri functioned \\nbelied the fact that it was the most populous city in the entire empire. The last census just two \\nyears backhad pegged the population of the city at two hundred thousand. \\n\\nNandi led Shiva and the three soldiers to one of the city’s numerous guest houses, built for the \\nmany tourists that frequented Devagiri, for both business and leisure. Tying up their horses in the \\ndesignated area outside the guest house, the party walked in to register themselves and check into \\ntheir rooms. The guest house had a style similar to the many that Shiva had seen throughout their \\njourney. There was a central courtyard with the building built around it. The rooms were \\ncomfortably furnished and spacious. \\n\\n‘My Lord, it’s almost time for dinner,’said Nandi. ‘I will speak with the housekeeper and have \\nsome food arranged. We should eat early and get enough sleep since our appointment with the \\nEmperor has been fixed at the beginning of the second prahar tomorrow’ \\n\\n‘Sounds like a good idea.’ \\n\\n‘Also, if it is all right with you, shall I dismiss the soldiers and send them back to Srinagar?’ \\n\\n‘That also sounds like a good idea,’ said a smiling Shiva. Why Nandi, you are almost like a fount \\nof brilliant ideas! ’ \\n\\nNandi laughed along with Shiva, always happy to be the cause of a smile on his Lord’s face. \\n‘I’ll just be back, my Lord.’ \\n\\nShiva lay down on his bed and was quickly lost in the thoughts that really mattered to him. \\n\\nI’ll finish the meeting with the Emperor as soon as humanly possible, give him whatever the \\nbloody hell he wants and then scour the city for Sati. \\n\\nShiva had considered asking Nandi about the whereabouts of Sati but had eventually decided \\nagainst it. He was painfully aware that he had made a less than spectacular impression on her at \\ntheir first meeting. If she hadn’t made it easy for him to find her, it only meant that she wasn’t \\nterribly stirred by him. He didn’t want to compound the issue by speaking casually about her to \\nothers. \\n\\nHe smiled as the memory of her face came flooding back to him. He replayed the magical \\nmoments when he had seen her fighting. Not the most romantic of sights for most men of his \\n\\n\\n\\ntribe. But for Shiva, it was divine. He sighed recalling her soft, delicate body, which had suddenly \\ndeveloped brutal, killer qualities upon being attacked. The curves that had so captivated him swung \\nsmoothly as she transferred her weight to swing her sword. The sober tied hair had swayed \\nsensuously with each move of the sword arm. He breathed deeply. \\n\\nWhat a woman! \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt was early in the morning when Shiva and Nandi crossed the bridge between the Tamra and \\nSvarna platforms to reach the royal citadel. The bridge, another marvel of Meluhan engineering, \\nwas flanked on the sides by a thick wall. Holes had been drilled on the walls, to shoot arrows or \\npour hot oil on enemies. The bridge was bisected by a massive gate, a final protection just in case \\nthe other platform was lost to an enemy. \\n\\nWhen they crossed over to the Svarna platform, Shiva was completely taken by surprise, not \\nby the grandeur of the royal area but by the lack of it. He was shocked by the fact that there was \\nno opulence. Despite ruling over such a massive and wealthy empire, the nobility lived in a \\nconspicuously simple manner. The structure of the royal citadel was almost exacdy like the other \\nplatforms. There were no special concessions for the aristocrats. The same block structures that \\ndominated all of Meluha were to be found in the royal citadel as well. The only magnificent \\nstructure was to the far right and sported the sign ‘Great Public Bath’. The Bath also had a glorious \\ntemple to Lord Indra to the left. The temple, built of wood, stood on a raised foundation of baked \\nbricks, its cupola plated with solid gold! It seemed that special architecture was reserved only for \\nstructures built for the Gods or ones that were for the common good. \\n\\nProbably j ust like how Lord Ram would have preferred. \\n\\nThe only concession to the emperor, however, was that his standard block structure was larger \\nthan the others. Significantly larger. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nShiva and Nandi entered the royal private office to find Emperor Daksha sitting on a simple \\nthrone at the far end of the modesdy furnished room, flanked by a man and a woman. \\n\\nDaksha, greeting Shiva with a formal namaste, said. ‘I hope your journey was comfortable.’ \\n\\nHe looked too young to be an emperor of such a large country. Though he was marginally \\nshorter than Shiva, the major difference between them was the musculature. While the strapping \\nShiva was powerfully built, Daksha’s body showed that it had not been strained by too much \\n\\n\\n\\nexercise. He wasn’t obese either. Just average. The same could be said about his wheatish \\ncomplexioned face. Average sized, dark eyes flanked a straight nose. He wore his hair long life \\nmost Meluhan men and women. The head bore a majestic crown with the sun symbol of the \\nSuryavanshis manifested in the centre through sparkling gem stones. An elegant dhoti, with an \\nangvastram hung down the right shoulder and a large amount of functional jewellery, including \\ntwo amulets on his right arm, complemented Daksha’s average appearance. His only \\ndistinguishing feature was his smile — which spread its innocent conviction all the way to his \\neyes. Emperor Daksha looted like a man who wore his royalty lightly. \\n\\n‘Yes it was, your highness,’replied Shiva. The infrastructure in your empire is wonderful. You \\nare an extraordinary emperor.’ \\n\\n‘Thank you. But I only deserve reflected credit. The work is done by my people,’ \\n\\n‘You are too modest, your Highness.’ \\n\\nSmiling politely, Daksha asked, ‘May I introduce my most important aides?’Without waiting \\nfor an answer, he pointed to the woman on his left, ‘This is my prime minister, Kanakhala. She \\ntakes care of all administrative, revenue and protocol matters.’ \\n\\nKanakhala did a formal namaste to Shiva. Her head was shaved except for a tuft of smooth \\nhair at the back which had been tied in a knot. She had a string called the janau tied across from \\nher left shoulder down to the right side of her torso. She looted young like most Meluhans, but was \\na little overweight as was clearly evident from the excess flesh she bore between the white blouse \\nand dhoti. She had a dark and incredibly smooth complexion and like all her countrymen, wore \\njewellery that was restrained and conservative. Shiva noticed that the second amulet on \\nKanakhala’s arm showed a pigeon. Not a very high chosen-tribe amongst the Brahmins. Shiva \\nbent low and did a formal Namaste in reply. \\n\\nPointing to his right, Daksha said, ‘And this is my chief of the armed forces, General \\nParvateshwar. He looks after the army, navy, special forces, police etc’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted like a man that Shiva would think twice about taking on in a battle. He was \\ntaller than Shiva and had an immensely muscular physique that dominated the space around him. \\nHis curly and long hair had been combed fastidiously and fell neady from under his crown. His \\nsmooth, swarthy skin was marked by the proud signs of long years in battle. His body was \\nhairless, in a rare departure from the normally hirsute Kshatriya men who took body hair to be a \\nsign of machismo. Probably to mate up for this deficiency, Parvateshwar maintained a thickand \\nlong moustache which curled upwards at the edges. His eyes reflected his uncompromisingly \\nstrong and righteous character. The second amulet on his arm showed Parvateshwar as a tiger, a \\nvery high chosen-tribe amongst the Kshatriyas. He nodded curdy at Shiva. No Namaste. No \\nelaborate bow of his proud head. Shiva, however, smiled warmly and greeted Parvateshwar with \\na formal Namaste. \\n\\n‘Please wait outside, Captain,’ advised Parvateshwar, looking at Nandi. \\n\\nBefore Nandi could respond, Shiva cut in. ‘My apologies. But is it alright if Nandi stays here \\nwith me? He has been my constant companion since I left my homeland and has become a dear \\nand trusted friend.’ \\n\\n‘Of course he may,’ replied Daksha. \\n\\n‘Your Highness, it is not appropriate for a Captain to be witness to this discussion,’ said \\nParvateshwar. ‘In any case, his service rules clearly state that he can only escort a guest into the \\n\\n\\n\\nemperor’s presence and not stay there while a matter of state is discussed.’ \\n\\n‘Oh relax Parvateshwar. You take your service rules too seriously sometimes.’ Turning to \\nShiva, Daksha continued, ‘If it is alright with you, may we see your necknow?’ \\n\\nNandi slid behind Shiva to untie the cravat. Seeing the beads darned on the cravat to convey the \\nimpression that the throat was covered for religious reasons, Daksha smiled and whispered, ‘Good \\nidea.’ \\n\\nAs Nandi pulled Shiva’s cravat off, Daksha and Kanakhala came close to inspect Shiva’s throat \\nin greater detail. Parvateshwar did not step forward but strained his neck slightly to get a better \\nlook Daksha and Kanakhala seemed clearly stunned by what they saw. \\n\\nThe emperor felt the throat and whispered in awe, ‘The colour comes from the inside. It is not \\na dye. It is true and genuine.’ \\n\\nDaksha and Kanakhala glanced at each other, tears glistening in their astounded eyes. \\nKanakhala folded her hands into a namaste and began mumbling a chant under her breath. \\nDaksha looked up at Shiva’s face, trying desperately to suppress the ecstasy that coursed through \\nhis insides. With a controlled smile, the Emperor of Meluha said, 1 hope we have not done \\nanything to cause you any discomfort since your arrival in Meluha.’ \\n\\nDespite Daksha’s controlled reaction, Shiva could guess that both the emperor and his prime \\nminister were taken abackby his blue throat. \\n\\nJust how important is this bloody blue throat for the Meluhans? \\n\\n‘Umm, none at all your Highness,’replied Shiva as he tied the cravat back around his neck ‘In \\nfact, my tribe and I have been delighted by the hospitality that we have received here.’ \\n\\n‘I’m glad for that,’smiled Daksha, bowing his head politely. ‘You may want to rest a litde bit \\nand we could talk in more detail tomorrow. Would you like to shift your residence to the royal \\ncitadel? It is rumoured that the quarters here are a litde more comfortable.’ \\n\\n‘That is a very kind offer, your Highness.’ \\n\\nDaksha turned to Nandi and asked, ‘Captain, what did you say your name was?’ \\n\\n‘My name is Nandi, your Highness.’ \\n\\n‘You too are welcome to stay here. Mate sure that you take good care of our honoured guest. \\nKanakhala, please mate all the arrangements.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, your Highness.’ \\n\\nKanakhala called in one of her aides, who escorted Shiva and Nandi out of the royal office. \\n\\nAs Shiva exited the room, Daksha went down on his haunches with great ceremony and \\ntouched his head to the ground on which Shiva had just stood. He mumbled a prayer sofdy and \\nstood up again to look at Kanakhala with tears in his eyes. Kanakhala’s eyes, however, betrayed \\nimpatience and a touch of anger. \\n\\n‘I didn’t understand, your Highness,’glared Kanakhala. ‘The blue mark was genuine. Why did \\nyou not tell him?’ \\n\\n‘What did you expect me to do?’cried a surprised Daksha. ‘This is his second day in Devagiri. \\nYou want me to just accost him and tell him that he is the Neelkanth, our saviour? That he has \\nbeen sent to solve all our problems?’ \\n\\n‘Well, if he has a blue throat, then he is the Neelkanth, isn’t he? And if he is the Neelkanth, then \\nhe is our saviour. He has to accept his destiny.’ \\n\\nAn exasperated Parvateshwar interjected. ‘I can’t believe that we are talking like this. We are \\n\\n\\n\\nMeluhans! We are the Suryavanshis! We have created the greatest civilisation ever known to \\nman. And some barbarian with no education, no skills, no merit is going to be our saviour? Just \\nbecause he has a blue throat?’ \\n\\n‘That is what the legend says Parvateshwar,’ countered Kanakhala. \\n\\nDaksha interrupted both his ministers. ‘Parvateshwar, I believe in the legend. My people \\nbelieve in the legend. The Neelkanth has chosen my reign to appear. He will transform all of \\nIndia to the ideals of Meluha — a land of truth, duty and honour. With his leadership, we can end \\nthe Chandravanshi crisis once and for all. All the agonies they inflict upon us will be over — from \\nthe terrorist attacks to the shortage of Somras to the killing of the Saraswati.’ \\n\\n‘Then why delay telling him, your Highness?’asked Kanakhala. ‘The more days we waste, the \\nweaker becomes the resolve of our people. You know there was another terrorist attackjust a few \\ndays back at a village not far from Hariyupa. As our reaction becomes weak, our enemies \\nbecome bolder, your Highness. We must tell the Lord quickly and announce his arrival to our \\npeople. It will give us the strength to fight our cruel enemies.’ \\n\\n‘I will tell him. But I am trying to be more farsighted than you. So far our empire has only \\nfaced the morale-sapping influence of fraudulent Neelkanths. Imagine the consequences if \\npeople found out that the true Neelkanth has come but refuses to stand by us. First we must be \\nsure that he is willing to accept his destiny. Only then will we announce him to our people. And I \\nthink that the best way to convince him is to share the whole truth with him. Once he sees the \\nunfairness of the attacks we face, he will fight with us to destroy evil. If that takes time, so be it. \\nWe have waited for centuries for the Neelkanth. A few more weeks will not destroy us.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5 \\n\\n\\nT ribc of Brahma \\n\\nShiva was walking in the verdant gardens of the royal guest house. His things were being moved \\ninto the royal guest house by Nandi and Kanakhala’s efficient aide. Shiva sat down on a \\ncomfortable bench overlooking a bed of red and white roses. The charming cool breeze in the \\nopen gardens brought a smile to his face. It was early afternoon and the garden was deserted. \\nShiva’s thoughts kept going backto the conversation he had had with the Emperor in the morning. \\nDespite Daksha’s controlled reaction, Shiva could understand that his blue throat was of great \\nsignificance to the Meluhans, even to the Emperor. It meant that the legend of the Neelkanth, \\nwhatever it was, was not restricted to some small sect in Kashmir. If the Emperor himself took it \\nso seriously, all of Meluha must need the help of the Neelkanth. \\n\\nBut what the bloody hell do they want help for? They are so much more advanced than us! \\n\\nHis thoughts were distracted by the sounds of a dhol, a percussion instrument and some \\nghungroos, anklets worn by dancers. Someone seemed to be practising in the garden. A hedge \\nseparated the dance pavilion from the rest of the garden. Shiva, himself a passionate dancer, \\nwould normally have stepped in to move to the rhythm of the beat, but his mind was preoccupied. \\nSome words floated in from the group that was dancing. \\n\\nTSlo my lady, you must let yourself go,’said a distinguished male voice. ‘It’s not a chore that \\nyou have to do. Enjoy the dance. You are trying too hard to remember all the steps rather than \\nletting the emotion of the dance flow through you.’ \\n\\nThen a lady’s voice interjected. ‘My lady, Guruji is right. You are dancing correcdy, but not \\nenjoying it. The concentration shows on your face. You have to relax a little bit.’ \\n\\n‘Let me get the steps right first. Then I can learn to enjoy them.’ \\n\\nThe last voice made Shiva’s hair stand up on end. It was her. It was Sati. He quickly got up and \\nfollowed the sound of the voices. Coming up from behind the hedge, he saw Sati dancing on a \\nsmall platform. She had her hands raised rigidly to her sides as she enacted the various \\nmovements of the dance. She danced in accordance with the steps first to the left and then to the \\nright. She moved her shapely hips to the side and placed her hands precisely on her waist, to \\nconvey the mood of the dance. He was mesmerised once again. \\n\\nHowever, he did notice that though Sati was dancing all her steps correctly, the Guruji was \\nright. She was moving in a mechanical manner; the uninhibited surrender that is characteristic of \\na natural dancer was absent. The varying emotions of bliss and anger of the story being told were \\nmissing in her moves. And unlike a proficient dancer, Sati wasn’t using the entire platform. Her \\n\\n\\n\\nsteps were small, which kept her movements constricted to the centre. \\n\\nThe dance teacher sat facing her and playing on a dhol to give Sati her beats. Her companion \\nKrittika sat to the right. It was the dance teacher who noticed Shiva first and immediately stood \\nup. Sati and Krittika turned around as well and were clearly astonished to find Shiva standing in \\nfront of them. Unlike Sati, Krittika could not control her surprise and blurted out, ‘Shiva?’ \\n\\nSati, in her characteristic composed and restrained manner, asked sincerely, ‘Is everything \\nalright, Shiva? Do you need my help for something?’ \\n\\nHow have you been? I’ve missed you. Don’t you ever smile? \\n\\nShiva continued to stare at Sati, the words running through his mind, not on his lips. A smiling \\nKrittika looked at Sati for her reaction. An even more serious Sati repeated, very politely, ‘Can I \\nhelp you with something, Shiva?’ \\n\\n‘No, no, I don’t need any help,’ replied Shiva as reality seemed to enter his consciousness \\nagain. ‘I just happened to be in the area and heard your dancing. I mean your talk Your dance \\nsteps were not so hard that I could hear it. You were dancing very accurately. Actually, \\ntechnically it was all...’ \\n\\nKrittika interjected. ‘You know a bit about dancing, do you?’ \\n\\n‘Oh, not much. Just a little,’said Shiva to Krittika with a smile, before turning rapidly back to \\nSati. ‘My apologies Sati, but Guruj i is right. You were being far too methodical. As they say in the \\nland that I come from, the mudras and the kriyas were all technically correct. But the bhav or \\nemotion was missing. And a dance without bhav is like a body without a soul. When the emotions \\nof the dancer participate, she would not even need to remember the steps. The steps come on \\ntheir own. The bhav is something that you cannot learn. It comes to you if you can create the \\nspace in your heart for it.’ \\n\\nSati listened patiently to Shiva without saying a word. Her eyebrows were raised slightly as the \\nbarbarian spoke. How could he know more than a Suryavanshi about dancing? But she reminded \\nherself that he had saved her life. She was duty bound to honour him. \\n\\nKrittika, however, took offence at this caste-unmarked foreigner pretending that he knew more \\nabout dancing than her mistress. She glowered at Shiva. ‘You dare to think that you know more \\nthan one of the best dancers in the realm?’ \\n\\nShiva gathered he may have caused some offence. He turned to Sati in all seriousness. ‘I am \\nterribly sorry. I didn’t mean to insult you in any way. Sometimes I just keep talking without \\nrealising what I am saying.’ \\n\\n‘No, no’, replied Sati. ‘You did not insult me. Perhaps you are right. I don’t feel the essence of \\nthe dance as much as I should. But I am sure that with Guruj i’s guidance, I will pick it up in due \\ntime.’ \\n\\nSeizing his chance to impress Sati, Shiva said, ‘If it is alright with you, may I perform the \\ndance? I am sure that I am not as technically correct as you. But perhaps, there may be \\nsomething in the sentiment that will guide me through the correct steps.’ \\n\\nThat was wellput! She can’t say no! \\n\\nSati looted surprised. This was unexpected. ‘Umm, okay,’ she managed to say. \\n\\nA delighted Shiva immediately moved to the centre of the stage. He took off the angvastram \\ncovering his upper body and tossed it aside. Krittika’s quick anger at the perceived insult to her \\nmistress was forgotten quickly as she sighed at Shiva’s rippling physique. Sati, though, began to \\n\\n\\n\\nwonder how Shiva would bend such a muscular body into the contortions that were required for \\nthis style of dancing. Flexibility was usually sacrificed by a human body at the altar of strength. \\n\\nPlaying lightly on his dhol, the Guruji asked Shiva, Tell me the beat that you are comfortable \\nwith, young man.’ \\n\\nShiva folded his hands into a namaste, bent low and said, ‘Guruji, could you just give me a \\nminute please? I need to prepare for the dance.’ \\n\\nDancing was something Shiva knew as well as warfare. Facing east, he closed his eyes and \\nbowed his head slightly. Then he bent down on his knees and reverentially touched the ground \\nwith his head. Standing up, he turned his right foot outwards. Then he raised his left leg off the \\nfloor in a graceful arching movement till the foot was above knee height, as he bent his right knee \\nslightly to balance himself. His left foot pointed in a direction exactly between the bearing of his \\nright foot and his face. Only a calm breeze broke the almost deathly silence that enveloped the \\naudience. The Guruji, Sati and Krittika looted in amazement at Shiva. They did not understand \\nwhat he was doing but could feel the energy that Shiva’s stance was emanating. \\n\\nShiva raised both his arms in an elegant circular movement to the sides to bring them in line \\nwith his shoulder. His right hand was moulded into a position like it was holding an imaginary \\ndumru, a small, handheld percussion instrument. His left hand was open with its palm facing \\nupward, almost like it was receiving some divine energy. He held this pose for some time; as his \\nglowing face showed that Shiva was withdrawing into his own world. Then his right hand moved \\neffortlessly forward, almost as if it had a mind of its own. Its palm was now open and facing the \\naudience. Somehow, the posture seemed to convey a feeling of protection to a very surprised \\nSati. His left arm then moved slowly from its shoulder height position to come in front of him with \\nthe palm facing down. The left arm stopped moving when the hand was pointing almost directiy \\nat the left foot. Shiva held this pose for some time. And then began the dance. \\n\\nSati stared in wonder at Shiva. He was performing the same steps as her. Yet it looted like a \\ncompletely different dance. His hands moved effortlessly as his body moved almost magically. \\n\\nHow could a body this muscular also be so flexible? The Guruji tried helplessly to get his dhol \\nto give Shiva the beats. But clearly that wasn’t necessary. For it was Shiva’s feet which were \\nleading the beat for the dhol! \\n\\nThe dance conveyed the various emotions of a woman. At the beginning it conveyed her \\nfeelings of joy and lust as she cavorted with her husband. Then it conveyed her fury and pain on \\nthe wrongful death of her mate. Even with Shiva’s rough masculine body, he managed to convey \\nthe tender yet strong emotions of a grieving woman. \\n\\nShiva’s eyes were open. But the audience realised that he was oblivious to them. Shiva was in \\nhis own world. He did not dance for the audience. He did not dance for appreciation. He did not \\ndance for the music. He danced only for himself. Rather, it almost seemed like his dance was \\nguided by a celestial force. Sati realised that Shiva was right. He had opened himself and the \\ndance had come to him. \\n\\nAfter what seemed like an eternity the dance came to an end, with Shiva firmly shutting his \\neyes. He held the final pose for a long time as the glow slowly left him. It was almost like he was \\nreturning to this world. Shiva gradually opened his eyes to find Sati, Krittika and the Guruji gaping \\nat him in complete awe. \\n\\nThe Guruj i was the first to find his voice. ‘Who are you?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘I am Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘No, no. Not the body. I meant who are you?\\' \\n\\nShiva crooked his eyes together in a frown and repeated, ‘I am Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘Guruji, may I aska question?’ asked Sati. \\n\\n‘Of course you may.’ \\n\\nTurning to Shiva, Sati asked, ‘What was that you did before the dance? Was it some kind of \\npreparatory step?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. It’s called the Natarajpose. The pose of the Lord of dance! \\n\\n‘The Nataraj pose? What does it do?’ \\n\\n‘It aligned my energy to the universal energy so that the dance emerges on its own.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t understand.’ \\n\\n‘Well, it’s like this: amongst our people, we believe that everything in the world is a carrier of \\nshakti ox energy. The plants, animals, objects, our bodies, everything carries and transmits \\nenergy. But the biggest carrier of energy that we are physically in touch with is Mother Earth \\nherself — the ground that we walk on.’ \\n\\n‘What does that have to do with your dance?’ \\n\\n‘For anything that you do, you need energy. You have to source the energy around you. The \\nenergy comes from people, from objects, from Mother Earth herself. You have to ask for that \\nenergy respectfully.’ \\n\\n‘And your Nataraj pose helps you to access any energy that you want?’ asked the Guruj i. \\n\\n‘It depends on what I want the energy for. The Nataraj pose helps me to ask respectfully for \\nenergy for a dance that wants to come to me. If I wanted the energy for a thought to come to \\nme, I would have to sit cross-legged and meditate.’ \\n\\n‘It seems that the energy favours you, young man,’said the Guruji. ‘You are the Nataraj, the \\nLord of dance!’ \\n\\n‘Oh nol’exclaimed Shiva. ‘I am just a medium of the boundless Nataraj energy. Anyone can \\nbe the medium.’ \\n\\n‘Well, then you are a particularly efficient medium, young man,’said the Guruji. Turning to \\nSati, he said, ‘You don’t need me if you have a friend like him, my child. If you want to be taught \\nby Shiva, it would be my honour to excuse myself.’ \\n\\nShiva looked at Sati expectantly. This had gone much better than he expected. \\n\\nSay yes, dammit! \\n\\nSati however seemed to withdraw into herself. Shiva was starded to see the first signs of \\nvulnerability in this woman. She bowed her head, an act which did not suit her proud bearing and \\nwhispered softly, ‘I mean no disrespect to anyone, but perhaps I do not have the skills to receive \\ntraining of this level.’ \\n\\n‘But you do have the skill,’argued Shiva. ‘You have the bearing. You have the heart. You can \\nvery easily reach that level.’ \\n\\nSati looted up at Shiva, her eyes showing just the slightest hint of dampness. The profound \\nsadness they conveyed took Shiva aback \\n\\nWhat the hell is going on? \\n\\n‘I am very far from any level, Shiva,’ mumbled Sati. \\n\\nAs she said that, Sati found the strength to control herself again. The politely proud manner \\n\\n\\n\\nreturned to her face. The maskwas back ‘It is time for my puja. With your permission Guruji, I \\nmust leave.’ She turned towards Shiva. ‘It was a pleasure meeting you again Shiva.’ \\n\\nBefore Shiva could respond, Sati turned quickly and left, followed by Krittika. \\n\\nThe Guruji continued to stare at a flummoxed Shiva. At length, he bent low with a formal \\nnamaste towards Shiva and said, ‘It has been my life’s honour to see you dance.’ \\n\\nThen he too turned and left. Shiva was left wondering at the inscrutable ways of the Meluhans. \\n\\n— Aom - \\n\\nIt was late in the morning the next day when Shiva and Nandi entered the private royal office \\nto find Daksha, Parvateshwar and Kanakhala waiting for him. A surprised Shiva said, ‘I am sorry \\nyour Highness. I thought we were to meet four hours into the second prahar. I hope I haven’t kept \\nyou waiting.’ \\n\\nDaksha, who had stood up with a formal namaste, bowed low and said, ‘No, my Lord. You \\ndon’t need to apologise. We came in early so that we wouldn’t keep you waiting. It was our \\nhonour to wait for you.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar rolled his eyes at the extreme subservience that his emperor, the ruler of the \\ngreatest civilisation ever established, showed towards this barbarian. Shiva, controlling his \\nextreme surprise at being referred to as the ‘Lord’by the emperor, bowed low towards Daksha \\nwith a namaste and sat down. \\n\\n‘My Lord, before I start off my monologue about the legend of the Neelkanth, do you have \\nany questions that you would like to ask?’ enquired Daksha. \\n\\nThe most obvious question came to Shiva’s mind first. \\n\\nWhy in the holy lake’s name is my blessed blue throat so important? \\n\\nBut his instincts told him that though this appeared to be the most obvious question, it could not \\nbe answered unless he understood more about the society of Meluha itself. \\n\\n‘It may sound like an unusual question your Highness,’said Shiva. ‘But may I ask what your \\nage is?’ \\n\\nDaksha looked in surprise at Kanakhala. Then turning back towards Shiva with an awed smile, \\nhe said, ‘You are exceptionally intelligent my Lord. You have asked the most pertinent question \\nfirst.’ Crinkling his face into a conspiratorial grin, Daksha continued, ‘Last month I turned one \\nhundred and eighty four.’ \\n\\nShiva was stunned. Daksha did not look a day older than thirty years. In fact nobody in Meluha \\nlooked old. Except for the Pandit that Shiva had met at the Brahma temple. \\n\\nSo Nandi is more than a hundred years old. \\n\\n‘How can this be, your Highness?’ asked a flabbergasted Shiva. ‘What sorcery makes this \\npossible?’ \\n\\n‘There is no sorcery at all my Lord,’ explained Daksha. ‘What makes this possible is the \\nbrilliance of our scientists who make a potion called the Somras, the drink, of the gods. Taking the \\n\\n\\n\\nSomras at defined times not only postpones our death considerably, but it also allows us to live our \\nentire Eves as if we are in the prime of our youth — mentally and physically ’ \\n\\n‘But what is the Somras? Where does it come from? Who invented it?’ \\n\\n‘So many questions my Lord,’smiled Daksha. ‘But I will try my best to answer them one by \\none. The Somras was invented many thousands of years ago by one of the greatest Indian \\nscientists that ever lived. His name was Lord Brahma.’ \\n\\n‘I think there is a temple dedicated to him that I visited on the way to Devagiri. At a place \\nnamed Meru?’ \\n\\n‘Yes my Lord. That is where he is said to have lived and worked. Lord Brahma was a prolific \\ninventor. But he never took any of the benefits of his inventions for himself. He was always \\ninterested in ensuring that his inventions were used for the good of mankind. He realised early on \\nthat a potion as powerful as the Somras could be misused by evil men. So he implemented an \\nelaborate system of controls on its use.’ \\n\\n‘What kind of controls?’ \\n\\n‘He did not give the Somras freely to everyone,’ continued Daksha. After conducting a rigorous \\ncountry-wide survey, he chose a select group of adolescent boys of impeccable character — one \\nfrom each of the seven regions of ancient India. He chose young boys so that they would live \\nwith him at his gurukul and he could mould their character into selfless helpers of society. The \\nSomras medicine was administered only on these boys. Since these boys were practically given \\nan additional life due to the Somras, they came to be known as the dwija or twice born. With the \\nstrength of the Somras, the training of Lord Brahma and the numerous other inventions that they \\ncollectively produced, this group became more powerful than anyone in history. They honed \\ntheir minds to achieve almost superhuman intelligence. The ancient Indian title for men of \\nknowledge was Rishi. Since Lord Brahma’s chosen men were seven in number, they came to be \\nknown as the Saptrishi ? \\n\\n‘And these Saptrishis used their skills for the good of society ’ \\n\\n‘Yes my Lord. Lord Brahma instituted strict rules of conduct for the Saptrishis. They were not \\nallowed to rule or to practice any trade — essentially anything that would have caused them \\npersonal gain. They had to use their skills to do the task of priests, teachers, doctors, amongst other \\nintellectual professions where they could use their powers to help society. They were not allowed \\nto charge anything for their services and had to live on alms and donations from others.’ \\n\\n‘Tough service rules,’joked Shiva with a slight winkat Parvateshwar. \\n\\nParvateshwar did not respond but Daksha, Kanakhala and Nandi guffawed loudly. Shiva took a \\nquick look at the prahar lamp by the window. It was almost the third prahar. The time that Sati \\nwould probably come out to dance. \\n\\n‘But they followed their code of conduct stricdy my Lord,’continued Daksha. ‘Over time, as \\ntheir responsibilities grew, the Saptrishis selected many more people to join their tribe. Their \\nfollowers swore by the same code that the Saptrishis lived by and were also administered the \\nSomras. They devoted their lives to the pursuit of knowledge and for the wellbeing of society \\nwithout asking for any material gain in return. It is for this reason that society accorded these \\npeople almost devotional respect. Over the ages the Saptrishis and their followers came to be \\nknown as the Tribe of Brahma or simply, the Brahmins\\'. \\n\\n‘But as it usually happens with all good systems over long periods of time, some people stopped \\n\\n\\n\\nfollowing the Brahmin code, right?’ \\n\\n‘Absolutely, my Lord,’answered Daksha, shaking his head at the all too familiar human frailty. \\n‘As many millennia went by, some of the Brahmins forgot the strict code that Lord Brahma had \\nenforced and the Saptrishis propagated. They started misusing the awesome powers that the \\nSomras gave them for their own personal gains. Some Brahmins started using their influence over \\nlarge number of people to conquer kingdoms and start ruling. Some Brahmins misused other \\ninventions of the Saptrishis and Lord Brahma to accumulate fabulous wealth for themselves.’ \\n\\n‘And some of the Brahmins,’interjected Kanakhala with a particular sense of horror, ‘even \\nrebelled against the Saptrishi Uttradhikaris’. \\n\\n‘Saptrishi Uttradhikaris?’ inquired Shiva. \\n\\n‘They were the successors to the Saptrishis my Lord,’clarified Kanakhala. ‘When any of the \\nSaptrishis knew that he was coming to the end of his mortal life, he would appoint a man from his \\ngurukul as his successor. This successor was treated for all practical purposes like the Saptrishi \\nhimself.’ \\n\\n‘So rebelling against the Saptrishi Uttradhikaris was like rebelling against the Saptrishis \\nthemselves?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ answered Kanakhala. ‘And the most worrying part of this corruption was that it \\nwas being led by the higher chosen-tribe Brahmins like the eagles, peacocks and the swans. In \\nfact, due to their higher status, these chosen-tribes were actually not even allowed to work under \\nthe Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, lest they get enticed by the lure of the material world. Yet they \\nsuccumbed to the temptations of evil before anyone else.’ \\n\\n‘And chosen-tribes like yours, the pigeons, remained loyal to the old code despite working for \\nthe Kshatriyas?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ replied Kanakhala, her chest puffed up with pride. \\n\\nThe town bell indicating the beginning of the third prahar sounded out loudly. All the people in \\nthe room, including Shiva, said a quick short prayer welcoming the new time chapter. Shiva had \\nlearnt some of the ways of the Meluhans. A Shudra came in, reset the prahar lamp precisely and \\nleft as quiedy as he came. Shiva reminded himself that anytime now Sati would start her dance in \\nthe garden. \\n\\n‘So what revolution caused the change your Highness?’asked Shiva turning to Daksha. ‘You, \\nParvateshwar and Nandi are Kshatriyas and yet you clearly have taken the Somras. In fact I \\nhave seen people of all four castes in your empire lookyouthful and healthy. This means that the \\nSomras is now given to everybody. This change must have obviously happened due to a \\nrevolution, right?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord. And the revolution was known as Lord Ram. The greatest emperor that ever \\nlived! Jai Shri Ram! ’ \\n\\n‘Jai Shri Ram!’ repeated everyone in the room. \\n\\n‘His ideas and leadership transformed the society of Meluha dramatically,’continued Daksha. \\n‘In fact, the course of history itself was radically altered. But before I continue with Lord Ram’s \\ntale, may I make a suggestion?’ \\n\\n‘Of course, your Highness.’ \\n\\n‘It is into the third prahar now. Should we move to the dining room and partake of some lunch \\nbefore continuing with this story?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘I think it is an excellent idea to have lunch your Highness,’said Shiva. ‘But may I be excused \\nfor some time? There is another pressing engagement that I have. Could we perhaps continue our \\nconversation tomorrow if that is suitable to you?’ \\n\\nKanakhala’s face fell immediately while Parvateshwar’s was covered with a contemptuous \\ngrin. Daksha, however, kept a smiling face. ‘Of course we could meet tomorrow my Lord. Will \\nthe beginning of the second hour of the second prahar be all right with you?’ \\n\\n‘Absolutely, your Highness. My apologies for this inconvenience.’ \\n\\n‘Not at all my Lord,’said an ever smiling Daksha. ‘Can one of my chariots take you to your \\ndestination?’ \\n\\n‘That’s very kind of you, your Highness. But I will go there myself. My apologies once again.’ \\n\\nBidding a namaste to everyone in the room, Shiva and Nandi waited quickly out. Kanakhala \\nlooted accusingly at Daksha. The emperor just nodded his head, gesturing with his hands for \\ncalm. ‘It’s all right. We are meeting tomorrow, aren’t we?’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, we are running out of time,’ said Kanakhala. The Neelkanth needs to accept his \\nresponsibilities immediately!’ \\n\\n‘Give him time, Kanakhala. We have waited for so long. A few days is not going to cause a \\ncollapse!’ \\n\\nParvateshwar got up suddenly, bowed low towards Daksha and said, ‘With your permission \\nyour Highness, may I be excused? There are more practical things that need my attention as \\ncompared to educating a barbarian.’ \\n\\n‘You will speakof him with respect Parvateshwar,’ growled Kanakhala. ‘He is the Neelkanth! ’ \\n\\n‘I will speakof him with respect only when he has earned it through some real achievements,’ \\nsnarled Parvateshwar. ‘I respect only achievements, nothing else. That is the fundamental rule of \\nLord Ram. Only your karma is important. Not your birth. Not your sex. And certainly not the \\ncolour of your throat. Our entire society is based on merit. Or have you forgotten that?’ \\n\\n‘Enough!’exclaimed Daksha. ‘I respect the Neelkanth. That means everybody will respect \\nhim!’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6 \\n\\n\\nVikarma, the Carriers of Bad Fate \\n\\nNandi waited at a distance in the garden as he had been asked to, while Shiva went behind the \\nhedge to the dance area. The silent dance stage had already convinced Nandi that his Lord would \\nnot find anybody there. However, Shiva was filled with hope and waited expectandy for Sati. \\nAfter having waited for the larger part of an hour, Shiva realised that there would be no dance \\npractice today. Deeply disappointed, he waited silendy backto Nandi. \\n\\n‘Is there somebody I can help you find, my Lord?’ asked an earnest Nandi. \\n\\n‘No Nandi. Forget it.’ \\n\\nTrying to change the topic, Nandi said, ‘My Lord, you must be hungry. Should we go backto \\nthe guest house and eat?’ \\n\\n‘No, I’d like to see a litde more of the city,’ said Shiva, hoping that fate would be kind to him and \\nhe would run into Sati in the town. ‘Shall we go to one of the restaurants on the Raj at platform?’ \\n\\n‘That would be wonderful! ’smiled Nandi who hated the simple Brahmin-influenced vegetarian \\nfood served at the royal guest house. He missed the spicy meats that were served in rough \\nKshatriya restaurants. \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\n‘Yes, what is it Parvateshwar?’ asked Daksha. \\n\\n‘My Lord, I am sorry for the sudden meeting. But I just received some disturbing news and \\nhad to tell you this in private.’ \\n\\n‘Well, what is it?’ \\n\\n‘Shiva is already causing trouble.’ \\n\\n‘What have you got against the Neelkanth,’ groaned Daksha, raising his eyes in disapproval. \\n‘Why can’t you believe that the Neelkanth has come to save us?’ \\n\\n‘This has nothing to do with my views on Shiva, my Lord. If you will please listen to my news. \\nChenardhwaj saw Shiva in the gardens yesterday’ \\n\\n‘Chenardhwaj is here already?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Yes your Highness. His review with you has been fixed for the day after tomorrow’ \\n\\n‘Anyway, so what did Chenardhwaj see?’ \\n\\n‘He is also sickeningly taken in by the Neelkanth. So I think we can safely assume that he \\ndoesn’t have any prejudice.’ \\n\\n‘All right, I believe you. So what did he see the Neelkanth do?’ \\n\\n‘He saw Shiva dancing in the gardens,’ answered Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘So? Is there a law banning dance that I am not aware of?’ \\n\\n‘Please let me continue, your Highness. He was dancing while Sati watched in rapt attention.’ \\n\\nHis interest suddenly captivated, Daksha leaned forward to ask, ‘And?’ \\n\\n‘Sati behaved correcdy and left the moment Shiva tried to get too familiar. But Chenardhwaj \\nheard Shiva whisper something when Sati left.’ \\n\\n‘Well, what did he whisper?’ \\n\\n‘He whispered — Holy Lake, help me get her. I will not ask for anything else from you ever \\nagain! ’ \\n\\nDaksha appeared delighted. ‘You mean the Neelkanth may actually be in love with my \\ndaughter?’ \\n\\n‘Your Highness, you cannot forget the laws of the land,’exclaimed a horrified Parvateshwar. \\nYou know that Sati cannot marry ’ \\n\\n‘If the Neelkanth decided to marry Sati, no law on earth can stop him.’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, forgive me. But the entire basis of our civilisation is that nobody is above the law. \\nThat’s what mates us who we are. Better than the Chandravanshis and the Nagas. Not even Lord \\nRam was above the law. Then how can this barbarian be considered so important?’ \\n\\n‘Don’t you want Sati to be happy?’asked Daksha. ‘She’s also called Parvati for a reason — it’s \\nbecause she is your goddaughter. Don’t you want her to find joy again?’ \\n\\n‘I love Sati like the daughter I never had, your Highness,’ said Parvateshwar, with a rare \\ndisplay of emotion in his eyes. ‘I would do anything for her. Except breakthe law.’ \\n\\n‘That is the difference between you and me. For Sati’s sate, I would not mind breaking any \\nlaw. She is my daughter. My flesh and blood. She has suffered enough already. If I can find \\nsome way to mate her happy, I will do it. No matter what the consequences! ’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\nShiva and Nandi tied their horses in the designated area next to the main Raj at platform \\nmarket. Walking forward, Nandi guided Shiva towards one of his favourite restaurants. The \\ninviting aroma of freshly cooked meat brought forth a long-lost hunger in Nandi that had not been \\nsatisfied in the past two days at the royal guest house. The owner however stopped Shiva at the \\nentry. \\n\\n‘What’s the matter, brother?’ asked Nandi. \\n\\n‘I am deeply sorry brothers. But I too am undergoing religious vows at this time,’ said the \\n\\n\\n\\nrestaurant owner politely, pointing to the beads around his throat. ‘And you know that one of the \\nvows is that I cannot serve meat to fellow religious vow keepers.’ \\n\\nNandi blurted out in surprise, ‘But who has taken religious...’ \\n\\nHe was stopped by Shiva who signalled downwards with his eyes at the bead covered cravat \\naround his throat. Nandi nodded and followed Shiva out of the restaurant. \\n\\n‘This is the time of the year for religious vows, my Lord,’explained Nandi. Why don’t you \\nwait on the side? There are some good restaurants on the lane at the right. I will just go and check \\nif we have a restaurant owner who has not taken his vows.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded his ascent. As Nandi hurried off, Shiva looked around the street. It was a busy \\nmarket area with restaurants and shops spread evenly. But despite the large number of people and \\nthe commerce being conducted, the street was not bursting with noise. None of the shopkeepers \\ncame out to scream and advertise their wares. The customers spoke softly and in an unfailingly \\npolite manner, even if they were bargaining. \\n\\nThese well-mannered idiots would not be able to get any business done in our boisterous \\nmountain market! \\n\\nShiva, lost in his thoughts about the strange practices of the Meluhans, did not hear the \\nannouncement of the town crier till he was almost right behind him. \\n\\n‘Procession of vikarma women. Please move!’ \\n\\nA surprised Shiva turned around to find a tall Meluhan Kshatriya looking down at him. ‘Would \\nyou like to move aside, sir? A procession of vikarma women needs to pass for their prayers.’ \\n\\nThe crier’s tone and demeanour was unquestionably courteous. But Shiva was under no \\nillusions. The crier was not asking Shiva to move. He was telling him. Shiva stepped backto let the \\nprocession pass as Nandi touched him gendy on his arm. \\n\\n‘I have found a good restaurant, my Lord,’said an ecstatic Nandi. ‘One of my favourites. And \\nhis kitchen is going to run for at least an hour more. A lot of food to stuff ourselves with! ’ \\n\\nShiva laughed out loud. ‘It’s a wonder that just one restaurant can actually mate enough food to \\nsatisfy your hunger!’ \\n\\nNandi laughed along good naturedly as Shiva patted his friend on the back. \\n\\nAs they turned and waited into the lane, Shiva asked, ‘Who are vikarma women?’ \\n\\n‘Vikarma people, my Lord,’said Nandi sighing deeply, ‘are people who have been punished in \\nthis birth for the sins of their previous birth. Hence they have to live this life out with dignity and \\ntolerate their present sufferings with grace. This is the only way they can wipe their karma clean \\nof the sins of their previous births. Vikarma men have their own order of penance and women \\nhave a different order.’ \\n\\n‘There was a procession of vikarma women on the road we just left. Is their puja a part of the \\norder?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord. There are many rules that the vikarma women have to follow. They have to \\npray for forgiveness every month to Lord Agni, the purifying Fire God, through a specifically \\nmandated puja. They are not allowed to marry since they may poison others with their bad fate. \\nThey are not allowed to touch any person who is not related to them or is not part of their normal \\nduties. There are many other conditions as well that I am not completely aware of. If you are \\ninterested, we could meet up with a Pandit at the Agni temple later and he could tell you all about \\nvikarma people.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘No, I am not interested in meeting the Pandit right now,’ said Shiva with a smile. ‘He might just \\nbore me with some very confusing and abstruse philosophies! But tell me one thing. Who decides \\nthat the vikarma people had committed sins in their previous birth?’ \\n\\n‘Their own karma, my Lord,’said Nandi, his eyes pointing at the obvious. ‘For example if a \\nwoman gives birth to a still born child, why would she be punished thus unless she had committed \\nsome terrible sin in her previous birth. Or if a man suddenly contracts an incurable disease and \\ngets paralysed, why would it happen to him unless the universe was penalising him for the sins of \\nhis previous life.’ \\n\\n‘That sounds pretty ridiculous to me. A woman could have given birth to a still born child \\nsimply because she did not take proper care while she was pregnant. Or it could just be a disease. \\nHow can anyone say that she is being punished for the sins of her previous birth?’ \\n\\nNandi, shocked by Shiva’s opinion, struggled to find words to respond. He was a Meluhan and \\ndeeply believed in the concept of karma being carried over many births. He mumbled sofdy, ‘It’s \\nthe law, my Lord...’ \\n\\n‘Well, to be honest, it sounds like a rather unfair law to me.’ \\n\\nNandi’s crestfallen face showed that he was profoundly disappointed that Shiva did not \\nunderstand such a fundamental concept about Meluha. But he also kept his counsel for fear of \\nopposing what Shiva said. After all, Shiva was his Lord. \\n\\nSeeing a dejected Nandi, Shiva patted him gendy on the back. ‘Nandi, that was just my opinion. \\nIf the law works for your people, I am sure there must be some logic to it. Your society might be \\na litde strange at times, but it has some of the most honest and decent people I have ever met.’ \\n\\nAs a smile returned almost instantly to Nandi’s face, his whole being was overcome by his \\nimmediate problem. His debilitating hunger! He entered the restaurant as a man on a mission, \\nwith Shiva chuckling softly behind. \\n\\nA short distance away on the main road, the procession of vikarma women waited silently on. \\nThey were all draped in long angvastrams which were dyed in the holy blue colour. Their heads \\nwere bowed low in penitence, their puja thalis or prayer plates full of offerings to Lord Agni. The \\nnormally quiet market street became almost deathly silent as the pitiful women lumbered by. At \\nthe centre of the procession, unseen by Shiva, with her head bowed low, draped in a blue \\nangvastram that covered her from head to toe, her face a picture of resigned dignity, trudged the \\nforlorn figure of Sati. \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘So where were we, my Lord?’ said Daksha, as Shiva and Nandi setded down in his private \\noffice the next morning. \\n\\n‘We were about to discuss the changes that Lord Ram brought about, your Highness. And how \\nhe defeated the rebellion of the renegade Brahmins,’ answered Shiva. \\n\\n‘That’s right,’said Daksha. ‘Lord Ram did defeat the renegade Brahmins. But in his view, the \\n\\n\\n\\ncore problem went deeper. It wasn’t just an issue of some Brahmins who did not follow the code. \\nThe problem was a conflict between a person’s natural karma and what society forced him to do.’ \\n\\n‘I didn’t understand your Highness.’ \\n\\n‘If you think about it, what was the essential problem with the renegade Brahmins? Some of \\nthem wanted to be Kshatriyas and rule. Some of them wanted to be Vaishyas, make money and \\nlive a life of luxury. However, their birth confined them to being Brahmins.’ \\n\\n‘But I thought that Lord Brahma had decreed that people became Brahmins through a \\ncompetitive examination process,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘That is true my Lord. But over time this process of selection lost its fairness. Children of \\nBrahmins became Brahmins. Children of Kshatriyas became Kshatriyas and so on. The formal \\nsystem of selection soon ceased to exist. A father would ensure that his children got all the \\nresources and support needed to grow up and become a member of his own caste. So the caste \\nsystem became rigid.’ \\n\\n‘So did that also mean that there could have been a person talented enough to be a Brahmin but \\nif he was born to Shudra parents, he would not get the opportunity to become a Brahmin?’asked \\nShiva. \\n\\n‘Yes Shiva,’ said Parvateshwar, speaking for the first time to Shiva. He noticed that \\nParvateshwar did not fawn over him and call him Lord. ‘In Lord Ram’s view, any society that \\nconducted its transactions based on anything besides merit could not be stable. His view was that a \\nperson’s caste should be decided only on that person s karma. Not his birth. Not his sex. No other \\nreason should interfere.’ \\n\\n‘That is nice in theory, Parvateshwar,’argued Shiva. ‘But how do you ensure it in practice. If a \\nchild is born in a Brahmin family, he would get the upbringing and resources which would be \\ndifferent from that of a child born in a Shudra family. So this child would grow up to be a \\nBrahmin even if he was less talented than the Shudra boy. Isn’t this unfair to the child born in the \\nShudra family? Where is the “merit” in this system?’ \\n\\n‘That was the genius of Lord Ram, Shiva,’smiled Parvateshwar. ‘He was of course a brave \\ngeneral, a brilliant administrator and a fair judge. But his greatest legacy is the system he created \\nto ensure that a person’s karma is determined only by his abilities, nothing else. That system is \\nwhat has made Meluha what it is — the greatest nation in history ’ \\n\\n‘You can’t underestimate the role that Somras has played, Parvateshwar,’said Daksha. ‘Lord \\nRam’s greatest act was to provide the Somras to everyone. The elixir is what mates Meluhans the \\nsmartest people in the universe! The Somras is what has given us the ability to create this \\nremarkable and near perfect society.’ \\n\\n‘Begging your pardon, your Highness,’said Shiva before turning back to Parvateshwar. ‘But \\nwhat was the system that Lord Ram set up?’ \\n\\n‘The system is simple,’said Parvateshwar. ‘As we agreed, the best society is when a person’s \\ncaste is decided only by his abilities and karma. Not by any other factor. Lord Ram created a \\npractical system that ensured this. All children that are born in Meluha are compulsorily adopted \\nby the empire. To ensure that this is done methodically, a great hospital city called Maika was \\nbuilt deep in the south, just north of the Narmada river. All pregnant women have to travel there \\nfor their delivery. Only pregnant women are allowed into the city. Nobody else.’ \\n\\n‘Nobody else? What about her husband, her parents?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘No, there are no exceptions to this rule except for one. This exception was voted in around \\nthree hundred years ago. Husbands and parents of women of noble families were allowed to \\nenter,’answered Parvateshwar, his expression clearly showing that he violendy disagreed with \\nthis corruption of Lord Ram’s sy stem. \\n\\n‘Then who takes care of the pregnant woman in Maika?’ \\n\\n‘The hospital staff. They are well trained in this,’continued Parvateshwar. ‘Once the child is \\nborn, he or she is kept in Maika for a few weeks for health reasons while the mother travels back \\nto her own city ’ \\n\\n‘Without her child?’ asked a clearly surprised Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes,’ replied Parvateshwar, with a slight frown as if this was the most obvious fact in the \\nworld. ‘The child is then put into the Meluha Gurukul, a massive school created by the empire \\nclose to Maika. Every single child receives the benefit of exacdy the same education system. \\nThey grow up with all the resources of the empire available to them.’ \\n\\n‘Do they maintain records of the parents and their children?’ \\n\\n‘Of course they do. But the records are kept in utmost secrecy and only with the record-keeper \\nof Maika.’ \\n\\n‘That would mean that in the Gurukul or in the rest of the empire, nobody would know who the \\nchild’s birth parents are,’ reasoned Shiva, as he worked out the implications of what he was \\nhearing. ‘So every child, whether born to a Brahmin or a Shudra, would get exacdy the same \\ntreatment at the Gurukul?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ smiled Parvateshwar. He was clearly proud of the system. ‘As the children enter the age \\nof adolescence, they are all given the Somras. Thus every child has exactly the same opportunity \\nto succeed. At the age of fifteen, when they have reached adulthood, all the children are given a \\ncomprehensive examination. The results of this examination decide which varna or caste the \\nchild will be allocated to — Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya or Shudra.’ \\n\\nKanakhala cut in. ‘And then the children are given one more year’s caste-specific training. \\nThey wear their varna colour bands — white for Brahmins, red for Kshatriyas, green for \\nVaishyas and black for Shudras — and retreat to the respective caste schools to complete their \\neducation.’ \\n\\n‘So that’s why your caste system is called the varna system,’said Shiva. ‘\\'Varna means colour, \\nright?’ \\n\\n‘Yes my Lord,’ smiled Kanakhala. You are very observant.’ \\n\\nWith a withering look at Kanakhala, Parvateshwar added sarcastically, ‘Yes, that was a very \\ndifficult conclusion to draw.’ \\n\\nIgnoring the barb, Shiva asked, ‘So what happens after that?’ \\n\\n‘When the children turn sixteen, they are allocated to applicant parents from their caste. For \\nexample, if some Brahmin parents had applied to adopt a child, one randomly chosen student \\nfrom Maika, who had won the Brahmin caste in the examination, will be allotted to them. Then \\nthe child grows up with these adopted parents as their own child.’ \\n\\n‘And society is perfect,’marvelled Shiva, as the simple brilliance of the system enveloped his \\nmind. ‘Each person is given a position in society based only on his own abilities. The efficiency \\nand fairness of this system is astounding! ’ \\n\\n‘Over time my Lord,’interjected Daksha, ‘we found the percentage of higher castes actually \\n\\n\\n\\ngoing up in the population. Which means that everybody in the world has the ability to excel. All \\nit takes is for a child to be given a fair chance to succeed.’ \\n\\n‘Then the lower castes must have loved Lord Ram for this?’ asked Shiva. ‘He gave them an \\nactual chance to succeed.’ \\n\\n‘Yes they did love him,’answered Parvateshwar. ‘They were his most loyal followers. Jai Shri \\nRam!’ \\n\\n‘But I guess not too many mothers would have been happy with this. I can’t imagine a woman \\nwillingly giving up her child as soon as he is born with no chance of meeting him ever again.’ \\n\\n‘But it’s for the larger good,’ said Parvateshwar, scowling at the seemingly stupid question. ‘And \\nin any case, every mother who wants an offspring can apply for one and be allocated a child \\nwho suits her position and dreams. Nothing can be worse for a mother than having a child who \\ndoes not measure up to her expectations.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned at Parvateshwar’s explanation, but let the argument pass. ‘I can also imagine \\nthat many of the upper castes like the Brahmins would have been unhappy with Lord Ram. After \\nall, they lost their stranglehold on power.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’added Daksha. ‘Many upper castes did oppose Lord Ram’s reforms. Not just Brahmins, \\nbut even Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. Lord Ram fought a great battle to defeat them. Those of the \\nvanquished who survived are the Chandravanshis we see today ’ \\n\\n‘So your differences go that far back?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Daksha. ‘The Chandravanshis are corrupt and disgusting people. No morals. No \\nethics. They are the source of all our problems. Some of us believe that Lord Ram was too kind. \\nHe should have completely destroyed them. But he forgave them and let them live. In fact, we \\nhave to face the mortification of seeing the Chandravanshis rule over Lord Ram’s birthplace — \\nAyodhya!’ \\n\\nBefore Shiva could react to this information, the bell of the new prahar was rung. Everyone \\nsaid a quick prayer to welcome the subsequent time chapter. Shiva immediately looked towards \\nthe window. A look of expectancy appeared on his face. \\n\\nDaksha smiled as he observed Shiva’s expression. ‘We could break for lunch now, my Lord. \\nBut if you have another engagement you would life to attend, we could continue tomorrow’ \\n\\nParvateshwar glared at Daksha disapprovingly. He knew exacdy what the emperor was trying \\nto do. \\n\\n‘That would be nice, your Highness,’ smiled Shiva. ‘Is my face that transparent?’ \\n\\n‘Yes it is my Lord. But that is a gift you have. Nothing is prized more than honesty in Meluha. \\nWhy don’t you leave for your engagement and we could convene here again tomorrow \\nmorning?’ \\n\\nThanking Daksha profusely, Shiva left the room with Nandi in tow. \\n\\n— — \\n\\n\\n\\nShiva approached the hedge with excitement and trepidation. The moment he heard the sound \\nof the dhol coming from the garden, he despatched Nandi to have lunch at the guest house. He \\nwanted to be alone. He let out a deep sigh of ecstasy as he crept behind the hedge to find Sati \\npractising under the watchful eye of the Guruj i and Krittika. \\n\\n‘So good to see you again, Shiva,’ said the Guruj i as he stood up with a formal namaste. \\n\\n‘The pleasure is all mine, Guruj i,’said Shiva, as he bent down to touch the Guruji’s feet as a \\nsign of respect. \\n\\nSati watched silendy at a distance with her gaze on the floor. Krittika said enthusiastically, ‘I \\njust couldn’t get your dance out of my mind! ’ \\n\\nShiva blushed at the compliment. ‘Oh it wasn’t that good.’ \\n\\n‘Now you’re fishing for compliments,’ teased Krittika. \\n\\n‘I was wondering if we could start off where we left last time,’said Shiva, turning towards Sati. \\n‘I don’t think I have to be your teacher or anything like that. I just wanted to see you dance.’ \\n\\nSati felt her strange discomfort returning again. What was it about Shiva that made her feel that \\nshe was breaking the law in speaking with him? She was allowed to talk to men as long as she kept \\na respectable distance. Why should she feel guilty? \\n\\n‘I will try my best,’said Sati formally. ‘It would be enriching to hear your views on how I can \\nimprove myself. I really do respect you for your dancing skills.’ \\n\\nRespect?! Why respect? Why not love?! \\n\\nShiva smiled politely. Something inside told him that saying anything at this point of time would \\nspoil the moment. \\n\\nSati took a deep breath, girded her angvastram around her waist and committed herself to the \\nNataraj pose. Shiva smiled as he felt Mother Earth project her shakti, her energy, into Sati. \\n\\nEnergised by the earth she stood upon, Sati began her dance. And she had really improved. \\nThe emotions seemed to course through her. She was always good technically, but the passion \\nelevated her dance to the next level. Shiva felt a dreamy sense of unreality overcome him again. \\nSati radiated a magnetic hold on him as she moved her lithe body into the dance steps. For some \\nmoments, Shiva imagined that he was the man that Sati was longing for in her dance. When she \\nfinally came to a stop, the audience spontaneously applauded. \\n\\n‘That was the best I have ever seen you dance,’ said the Guruji with pride. \\n\\n‘Thankyou Guruj i,’ said Sati as she bowed. Then she looted expectandy at Shiva. \\n\\n‘It was fantastic,’exclaimed Shiva. ‘Absolutely fabulous. Didn’t I tell you that you had it in \\nyou?’ \\n\\n‘I thought that I didn’t get it exactly right at the attacking sequence,’ said Sati critically. \\n\\n‘You’re being too hard on yourself,’consoled Shiva. ‘That was just a slight error. It happened \\nonly because you missed one angle on your elbow. That made your next move a little odd.’ \\nRising swiftly to his feet, Shiva continued, ‘See, I’ll show you.’ \\n\\nHe waited quickly towards Sati and touched her elbow to move it to the correct angle. Sati \\nimmediately recoiled in horror as there was a gasp from the Guruji as well as Krittika. Shiva \\ninstantly realised that something terrible had happened. \\n\\n‘I am sorry,’said Shiva, with a look of sincere regret. ‘I was just trying to show you where \\nyour elbow should be.’ \\n\\nSati continued to stare at Shiva, stunned into immobility. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Guruj i was the first to recover his wits and realised that Shiva must undergo the purification \\nceremony. ‘Go to your Pandit, Shiva. Tell him you need a shudhikaran. Go before the day is \\nover.’ \\n\\n‘What? What is a shudhikaran? Why would I need it?’ \\n\\n‘Please go for a shudhikaran, Shiva,’ said Sati, as tears broke through her proud eyes. ‘If \\nsomething happened to you, I would never be able to forgive myself.’ \\n\\n‘Nothing will happen to me! Look, I am really sorry if I have broken some rule in touching \\nyou. I will not do it again. Let’s not make a big deal out of this.’ \\n\\n‘IT IS A BIG DEAL! ’ shouted Sati. \\n\\nThe violence of Sati’s reaction threw Shiva off balance. \\n\\nWhy the hell is this simple thing being blown completely out of proportion? \\n\\nKrittika came close to Sati, careful not to touch her and whispered, ‘We should go back home, \\nmy lady’ \\n\\n‘No. No. Please stay,’ pleaded Shiva. ‘I won’t touch you. I promise.’ \\n\\nWith a look of hopeless despair, Sati turned to leave, followed by Krittika and Guruj i. At the \\nedge of the hedge, she turned around and beseeched Shiva once again, ‘Please go for your \\nshudhikaran before nightfall. Please.’ \\n\\nAt the look of uncomprehending mutiny on Shiva’s face, the Guruj i advised, ‘Listen to her, \\nShiva. She speaks for your own good.’ \\n\\n— Aom — \\n\\n‘What bloody nonsense!’ yelled Shiva as his disturbed thoughts finally broke through his \\ndesperate efforts at silent acceptance. He was lying in his bedroom at the royal guest house. He \\nhad not undergone the shudhikaran. He had not even bothered to find out what the ceremony was. \\n\\nWhy would I need to be purified for touching Sati? I want to spend all my remainingyears \\ntouching her in every possible way. Am I going to keep on undergoing a shudhikaran every day? \\nRidiculous! \\n\\nJust then a troubling thought entered Shiva’s mind. \\n\\nIs it because of me? Am I not allowed to touch her because I am caste-unmarked? An inferior \\nbarbarian? \\n\\n‘No. That can’t be true,’whispered Shiva to himself. ‘Sati doesn’t think like that. She is a good \\nwoman.’ \\n\\nBut what if it’s true? Maybe if she knows I am the Neelkanth... \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 \\n\\n\\nLord Ram\\'s Unfinished Task \\n\\n‘You seem to be a little distracted this morning, my Lord. Are you alright?’ asked a concerned \\nDaksha. \\n\\n‘Hmm?’ said Shiva as he looted up. ‘I’m sorry your Highness. I was a litde distracted.’ \\n\\nDaksha looted with a concerned expression at Kanakhala. He had seen a similar look of despair \\non Sati’s face at dinner the previous night. But she had refused to say anything. \\n\\n‘Do you want to meet later?’ asked Daksha. \\n\\n‘Of course not, your Highness. It’s alright. My apologies. Please continue,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘Well,’ continued a concerned Daksha, ‘we were talking about the changes that Lord Ram \\nbrought about in society ’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Shiva, shaking his head slightly to get the disturbing image of Sati’s last plea out of his \\nmind. \\n\\n‘The Maika system worked fantastically well. Our society boomed. Ours was always one of \\nthe wealthiest lands on earth. But in the last one thousand two hundred years we have shot \\ndramatically ahead of everyone else. Meluha has become the richest and most powerful country \\nin the world by far. Our citizens lead ideal lives. There is no crime. People do what they are \\nsuited for and not what an unfair social order would compel them to do. We don’t force or fight \\nunprovoked wars with any other country. In fact, ours has become a perfect society.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, your Highness,’agreed Shiva, slowly getting into the conversation. ‘I don’t believe that \\nperfection can ever be achieved. It is more of a journey than a destination. But your society is \\ncertainly a near perfect society.’ \\n\\n‘Why do you thinkwe are not perfect?’ argued Parvateshwar aggressively. \\n\\n‘Do you think it is perfect Parvateshwar?’ asked Shiva politely. ‘Does everything in Meluha go \\nexactly as Lord Ram would have mandated?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar fell silent. He knew the obvious, even if he didn’t like the answer. \\n\\n‘The Lord is right Parvateshwar,’ said Daksha. ‘There are always things to improve.’ \\n\\n‘Having said that, your Highness,’ spoke Shiva, ‘your society is wonderful. Things do seem \\nvery well ordered. What doesn’t mate sense to me then, is why you and your people are so \\nconcerned about the future. What is the problem? Why is a Neelkanth required? I don’t see \\nanything that is so obviously wrong that disaster would be just a breath away. This is not like my \\nhomeland where there are so many problems that you wouldn’t know where to begin! ’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, a Neelkanth is needed because we are faced with challenges that we cannot \\n\\n\\n\\nconfront. We keep to ourselves and let other countries lead their lives. We trade with other \\nsocieties but we never interfere with them. We don’t allow uninvited foreigners into Meluha \\nbeyond the frontier towns. So we think it’s only fair that other societies leave us alone to lead our \\nlives the way we want to.’ \\n\\n‘And presumably they don’t, your Highness?’ \\n\\n‘No they don’t.’ \\n\\n‘Why?’ \\n\\n‘One simple word, my Lord,’replied Daksha. ‘Jealousy. They hate our superior ways. Our \\nefficient family system is an eyesore to them. The fact that we take care of everyone in our \\ncountry makes them unhappy because they can’t take care of themselves. They lead sorry lives. \\nAnd rather than improving themselves, they want to pull us down to their level.’ \\n\\n‘I can understand. My tribe used to face a lot of jealousy in Mount Kailash since we had \\ncontrol over the shore of the Mansarovar Late and hence the best land in the region. But \\nsometimes I wonder if we could have avoided bloodshed if we had shared our good fortune more \\nwillingly.’ \\n\\n‘But we do share our good fortune with those who wish it, my Lord. And yet, jealousy blinds \\nour enemies. The Chandravanshis realised that it was the Somras that guaranteed our superiority. \\nFunnily enough, even they have the knowledge of the Somras. But they have not learnt to mass \\nproduce it like we do and hence haven’t reaped all the benefits of it.’ \\n\\n‘Sorry to interrupt, your Highness, but where is the Somras produced?’ \\n\\n‘It is produced at a secret location called Mount Mandar. The Somras powder is manufactured \\nthere and then distributed throughout the empire. At designated temples across Meluha, trained \\nBrahmins mix it with water and other ingredients to administer it to the population.’ \\n\\n‘Alright,’ said Shiva. \\n\\nThe Chandravanshis could not become as powerful as us since they never had enough Somras. \\nEaten up by their jealousy, they devised a devious way to destroy the Somras and hence us. One \\nof the key ingredients in the Somras is the waters of the Saraswati. Water from any other source \\ndoes not work’ ‘Really ? Why?’ \\n\\nWe don’t know my Lord. The scientists can’t explain it. But only the waters of the Saraswati \\nwill do. That is why, the Chandravanshis tried to kill the Saraswati to harm us.’ \\n\\n‘Kill the river?’ asked Shiva incredulously. \\n\\n‘Yes my Lord!’said Daksha, as his childlike eyes flared up at the Chandravanshi perfidy. ‘The \\nSaraswati comes from the confluence of two mighty rivers up north — the Sutlej and the \\nYamuna. In the olden days, the course of the Sutlej and Yamuna used to be neutral territory. \\nBoth the Chandravanshis and we visited the land to draw waters for the Somras.’ \\n\\n‘But how did they try to kill the Saraswati your Highness?’ \\n\\n‘They diverted the course of the Yamuna so that instead of flowing south, it started flowing east \\nto meet their main river, Ganga.’ \\n\\n‘You can do that?’ asked Shiva in amazement. ‘Change the course of a river!’ \\n\\n‘Yes, of course you can,’ answered Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘We were livid,’interjected Daksha. ‘But we still gave them a chance to mate amends for their \\nduplicity’ \\n\\n‘And?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘What can you expect from the Chandravanshis, my Lord?’ said Daksha in disgust. They \\ndenied any knowledge of this. They claimed that the river made such a dramatic change in its \\ncourse all by itself, due to some minor earthquake. And even worse, they claimed that since the \\nriver had changed course of its own accord, we Meluhans would simply have to accept what was \\nessentially God’s will!’ \\n\\n‘We of course refused to do that,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘Under the leadership of King \\nBrahmanayak, his Highness’ father, we attacked Swadweep.’ \\n\\n‘The land of the Chandravanshis?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes Shiva,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘And it was a resounding victory. The Chandravanshi army \\nwas routed. King Brahmanayak kindly let them keep their lands and even their system of \\ngovernance. We didn’t even ask for any war reparations or yearly tribute either. The only term \\nof the surrender treaty was the return of the Yamuna. We restored the Yamuna to her original \\ncourse to meet with the Saraswati.’ \\n\\n‘You fought in that war, Parvateshwar?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Parvateshwar, his chest swollen with pride. ‘I was a mere soldier then. But I did fight \\nin that war.’ \\n\\nTurning to Daksha, Shiva asked, ‘Then what is the problem now, your Highness? Your enemy \\nwas comprehensively defeated. Then why is the Saraswati still dying?’ \\n\\nWe believe that the Chandravanshis are up to something again. We don’t understand it as yet. \\nAfter their defeat, the area between our two countries was made into a no-man’s land and the \\njungle has reclaimed it. That included the early course of the Yamuna as well. We stuck to our \\npart of the bargain and never disturbed that region. It appears that they didn’t honour their end of \\nthe promise.’ \\n\\n‘Are you sure of that your Highness? Has the area been checked? Has this been discussed with \\nthe Chandravanshis’ representative in your empire?’ \\n\\n‘Are you trying to say that we are lying?’countered Parvateshwar. True Suryavanshis don’t \\nlie!’ \\n\\n‘Parvateshwar! ’ scolded Daksha angrily. ‘The Lord was not implying anything like that.’ \\n\\n‘Listen to me, Parvateshwar,’said Shiva politely. ‘If I have learnt something from the poindess \\nbatdes of my land, it is that wars should be the last resort. If there is another solution possible, \\nthere is no harm in saving some young soldier’s life. A mother somewhere would bless us for it.’ \\n\\n‘Let’s not fight! Wonderful! What a great saviour we have!’Parvateshwar muttered under his \\nbreath. \\n\\n‘You have something to say Parvateshwar?’barked Kanakhala. ‘I have told you before. You \\nwill not insult the Neelkanth in my presence! ’ \\n\\n‘I don’t take orders from you,’ growled Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Enough!’ordered Daksha. Turning to Shiva, he continued, ‘I am sorry my Lord. You are right. \\nWe shouldn’t just declare war without being sure. That is why I have avoided a war till now. But \\nlookat the facts of the case. The flow of the Saraswati has been slowly depleting for the last fifty \\nyears.’ \\n\\n‘And the last few years have been horrible,’said Kanakhala as she controlled her tears at the \\nslow death of the river most Meluhans regarded as a mother. ‘The Saraswati doesn’t even reach \\nthe sea now and ends in an inland delta j ust south of Raj asthan.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘And the Somras cannot be made without water from the Saraswati,’continued Daksha. ‘The \\nChandravanshis know that and that is why they are trying to kill her.’ \\n\\n‘What does the Swadweep representative say about it? Has he been questioned?’ \\n\\n‘We have no diplomatic relations with Swadweep, my Lord,’ said Daksha. \\n\\n‘Really? I thought having representatives of other countries was one of your innovative \\nsystems. It gives you an opportunity to better understand them and maybe avoid jumping into a \\nwar. I had heard of a diplomatic mission from Mesopotamia coming in two days ago. Then why \\nnot have this with Swadweep as well?’ \\n\\n‘You don’t know them, my Lord. They are untrustworthy people. No follower of the \\nSuryavanshi way will dirty his soul by even speaking to a Chandravanshi willingly’ \\n\\nShiva frowned but didn’t say anything. \\n\\n‘You don’t know the levels they have sunk to my Lord. Over the previous few years they have \\neven started using the cursed Nagas in their terrorist attacks on us!’ said Kanakhala, with a \\ndisgusted look \\n\\n‘Terrorist attacks?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’said Daksha. Their defeat kept them quiet for many decades. And because of \\nour overwhelming victory in the previous war, they believe that they cannot overpower us in an \\nopen confrontation. So they have resorted to a form of assault that only repulsive people like them \\ncould turn to. Terrorist attacks.’ \\n\\n‘I didn’t understand. What exactly do they do?’ \\n\\n‘They send small bands of assassins who launch surprise attacks on non-military but public \\nplaces. Their idea is to attack non-combatants — the Brahmins, Vaishyas or Shudras. They try to \\ndevastate places like temples, public baths — areas where there may not be soldiers to fight back \\n— but whose destruction will wreckthe empire’s morale and spread terror.’ \\n\\n‘That’s disgusting! Even the Pakratis in my land, a bunch of complete barbarians, would not do \\nthat,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘These Chandravanshis don’t fight like men. They fight like cowards! ’ \\n\\n‘Then why don’t you attacktheir country ? Finish this once and for all.’ \\n\\n‘We would like to my Lord,’ said Daksha. ‘But I am not sure we can defeat them.’ \\n\\nShiva observed Parvateshwar seething silendy at the insult to his army, before turning towards \\nDaksha. ‘Why, your Highness? You have a well trained and efficient force. I am sure your army \\ncan defeat them.’ \\n\\n‘Two reasons, my Lord. Firsdy, we are outnumbered. We were outnumbered even a hundred \\nyears back But not by a very significant margin. But today, we estimate that they have a \\npopulation of more than eighty million compared to our eight million. They can throw a much \\nlarger army at us — their sheer numbers will cancel out our technological superiority.’ \\n\\n‘But why should your population be less? You have people who live beyond the age of two \\nhundred years! Your population should be higher.’ \\n\\n‘Sociological causes, my Lord,’ said Daksha. ‘Our country is rich. Children are a matter of \\nchoice, more than a duty. Parents would adopt children from the Maika system in small numbers, \\nmay be one or two, so that they could devote more attention on their upbringing. Fewer and \\nfewer mothers are giving birth at Maika as well. In Swadweep, for the poor, children are bonded \\nlabour to supplement a family’s income. The more children they have, the less poor the family. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo that country as a whole has a far larger population.’ \\n\\n‘And the second reason for avoiding war?’ \\n\\nThe second reason is something that is under our control. We fight with “rules of war”. With \\nnorms and ethics. The Chandravanshis do nothing like that. And I fear that this is a weakness in us \\nthat our ruthless enemies can exploit.’ \\n\\n‘Rules of war?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes. For example, we will not attackan unarmed man. A superior armed person life a cavalry \\nman will not attackan inferior armed person like a spear wielding foot-soldier. A swordsman will \\nnever attack a person below his waist because that is unethical. The Chandravanshis don’t care for \\nsuch niceties. They will attack whomsoever and however they find expedient to ensure victory’ \\n\\n‘Begging your pardon, your Highness,’said Parvateshwar. ‘But that difference is what makes \\nus who we are. like Lord Ram said, a person’s ethics and character are not tested in good times. It \\nis only in bad times that a person shows how steadfast he is to his dharma.’ \\n\\n‘But Parvateshwar,’sighed Daksha. ‘We are not under attack by people who are as ethical and \\ndecent as us. Our way of life is under assault. If we don’t fight back in any which way we can, \\nwe will lose.’ \\n\\n‘My apologies once again, your Highness,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘I have never said that we \\nshould not fight back. I am eager to attack. I have been asking repeatedly for permission to \\ndeclare war on the Chandravanshis. But if we fight without our rules, our codes, our ethics, then \\n“our way of life” is as good as destroyed. And the Chandravanshis would have won without even \\nfighting us!’ \\n\\nAt the ringing of the prahar town bell, the conversation was halted, as everyone said a quick \\nprayer. Shiva turned towards the window, wondering if Sati would be dancing today. \\n\\nDaksha turned to Shiva expectantly. ‘Do you need to leave my Lord?’ \\n\\n‘No, your Highness,’said Shiva, hiding the pain and confusion he felt inside. ‘I don’t believe I \\nam expected anywhere at this point of time.’ \\n\\nAt this, the smile on Daksha’s face disappeared with his hopes. Shiva continued, ‘If it is alright \\nwith you, your Highness, may we continue our conversation? Perhaps we can have our lunch a \\nlittle later.’ \\n\\n‘Of course we may, my Lord,’ smiled Daksha, pulling himself together. \\n\\n‘I have got the story so far, your Highness. While I can understand your reasons for not \\nwanting to attack right now, you clearly have a plan, in which my blue throat has some strange \\nrole to play ’ \\n\\n‘Yes, we do have a plan, my Lord. I feel that as an emperor, my giving in unthinkingly to the \\nrighteous anger of some of our people will not solve our problem. I believe that the people of \\nSwadweep themselves are not evil. It is their Chandravanshi rulers and their way of life that has \\nmade them evil. The only way forward for us is to save the Swadweepans themselves.’ \\n\\n‘Save the Swadweepans?’ asked Shiva, genuinely surprised. \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord. Save them from the evil philosophy that infects their soul. Save them from \\ntheir treacherous rulers. Save them from their sorry, meaningless existence. And we can do this \\nby giving them the benefits of the superior Suryavanshi way of life. Once they become like us, \\nthere will be no reason to fight. We will live like brothers. This is the unfinished task of my father, \\nKing Brahmanayak. In fact, it is the unfinished task of Lord Ram.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘That is a big task to take on, your Highness,’said Shiva. ‘It is sweeping in its kindness and \\nreason. But it is a very big task You will need soldiers to defeat their army and missionaries to \\nbring them to your side. It is not going to be easy.’ \\n\\n‘I agree. There are many in my empire who have concerns about even attacking Swadweep, \\nand I am putting forth a much bigger challenge to them, of reforming Swadweep. That is why I \\ndid not want to launch this without the Neelkanth, my Lord.’ \\n\\nShiva remembered his uncle’s words, spoken many years back in what was almost another \\nlife. Your destiny lies beyond the mountains. Whether you fulfil it or run away once again, is up to \\nyou. \\n\\nAs Daksha spoke once again, Shiva refocused his attention on him. \\n\\n‘The problems that we are facing were prophesied, my Lord,’continued Daksha. ‘Lord Ram \\nhad himself said that any philosophy, no matter how perfect, works only for a finite period. That \\nis the law of nature and cannot be avoided. But what the legends also tell us is that when the \\nproblems become insurmountable for ordinary men, the Neelkanth will appear. And that he will \\ndestroy the evil Chandravanshis and restore the forces of good. My Lord, you are the Neelkanth. \\nYou can save us. You can complete the unfinished task of Lord Ram. You must lead us and help \\nus defeat the Chandravanshis. You must rally the Swadweepans around to the side of good. \\nOtherwise I fear that this beautiful country that we have, the near perfect society of Meluha, will \\nbe destroyed in years of endless war. Will you help us my Lord? Will you lead us?’ \\n\\nShiva was confused. ‘But I didn’t understand, your Highness? What exactly would I do?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know, my Lord. We only know our destination and that you will be our leader. The path \\nwe take is up to you.’ \\n\\nThey want me to destroy the entire way of life of eighty million people by myself! Are they \\nmad? \\n\\nShiva spoke carefully. ‘I empathise with your people and their hardships, your Highness. But to \\nbe quite honest, I don’t really understand how one man like me can mate a difference.’ \\n\\n‘If that man is you my Lord,’said Daksha, his moist eyes opened wide in devotion and faith, \\n‘he can change the entire universe.’ \\n\\n‘I am not so sure of that, your Highness,’said Shiva with a weak smile. ‘Why will my being \\npresent mate such a difference? I am no miracle worker. I cannot snap my fingers and cause \\nbolts of lightning to descend on the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘It is your presence itself that will mate the difference, my Lord. I invite you to travel through \\nthe empire. See the effect your blue throat has on the people. Once my people believe that they \\ncan do it, they will be able to do it! ’ \\n\\n‘You are the Neelkanth, my Lord,’added Kanakhala. The people have faith in the bearer of the \\nblue throat. They will have faith in you. ‘Will you help us, my Lord?’ \\n\\nWill you run away once again? \\n\\n‘But how do you know that my blue throat mates me the genuine Neelkanth?’asked Shiva. ‘For \\nall you know, there may be many Meluhans with a blue throat waiting to be discovered! ’ \\n\\n‘No, my Lord,’said Daksha. ‘It cannot be a Meluhan. The legend says that the Neelkanth will \\nbe a foreigner. He cannot be from the Sapt-Sindhu. And that he will get a blue throat on drinking \\nthe Somras.’ \\n\\nShiva did not answer. He looted stunned as truth suddenly dawned upon him. \\n\\n\\n\\nSrinagar. The first night. Somras. That’s how my body got repaired. That’s why I’m feeling \\nstronger than ever. \\n\\nDaksha and Kanakhala looted at Shiva breathlessly, waiting for his decision. Praying for his \\nright decision. \\n\\nBut why only me? All the Gunas were given the Somras. Was my uncle right? Do I really have a \\ndestiny? \\n\\nParvateshwar stared at Shiva with narrowed eyes. \\n\\nI don’t deserve any destiny. But maybe this is my chance to redeem myself. \\n\\nBut first... \\n\\nShiva asked with controlled politeness, ‘Your Highness, before I answer, may I ask you a \\nquestion?’ \\n\\n‘Of course, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘Do you agree that honesty is required to mate any friendship work? Even if it means deeply \\noffending your friend with the truth?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, of course,’ replied Daksha, wondering where Shiva was going with this. \\n\\n‘Complete honesty is not just the bedrock of an individual relationship, but of any stable \\nsociety,’ interjected Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘I couldn’t agree more,’ said Shiva. ‘And yet, Meluha wasn’t honest with me.’ \\n\\nNobody said anything. \\n\\nShiva continued in a courteous, but firm tone. ‘When my tribe was being invited to come to \\nMeluha, we had the impression you wanted immigrants because you needed people to work And \\nI was happy to escape my benighted land. But now I realise that you were systematically \\nsearching for the Neelkanth.’ \\n\\nTurning to Nandi, Shiva said, ‘We weren’t told that a medicine called the Somras would be \\nadministered to us as soon as we entered. We weren’t told that the medicine would have such \\neffects.’ \\n\\nNandi looted down with guilty eyes. His Lord had the right to be angry with him. \\n\\nTurning to Daksha, Shiva continued, ‘Your Highness, you know that the Somras was probably \\nadministered to me on my first night in Kashmir, without my knowledge.’ \\n\\n‘I am truly sorry about that dishonesty my Lord,’ said Daksha, with his hands in a penitent \\nnamaste. ‘It’s something that I will always be ashamed of. But the states were too high for us. \\nAnd the Somras has considerably positive effects on your body. It doesn’t harm you in any way.’ \\n\\n‘I know. I am not exactly upset about having to live a long and healthy life,’said Shiva wryly. \\n‘Do you know that my tribe was also probably given the Somras that night? And they fell \\nseriously ill, perhaps because of the Somras.’ \\n\\n‘They were under no risk my Lord,’ said Kanakhala apologetically. ‘Some people are \\npredisposed towards certain diseases. When the Somras enters the body, it triggers the immediate \\noccurrence of these diseases, which when cured, never recur. Hence, the body remains healthy \\ntill death. Your tribe is actually much healthier now.’ \\n\\n‘No doubt they are,’said Shiva. ‘The point is not about the effects of the Somras. Both my tribe \\nand I are better for it. Yet, from what I understand of Meluha, getting somebody to do something \\nwithout telling him all the facts would not have been Lord Ram’s way. You should have told us the \\ncomplete truth at Mount Kailash. Then you should have let us mate an informed choice rather \\n\\n\\n\\nthan you making a choice for us. We probably would still have come to Meluha anyway but then \\nit would have been our choice.’ \\n\\n‘Please forgive us the deception, my Lord,’said Daksha, with guilty regret. ‘It is not our way to \\ndo something like this. We pride ourselves on our honesty. But we had no choice. We are truly \\nsorry, my Lord. Your people are well taken care of. They are healthier than ever. They will live \\nlong, productive lives.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar finally broke his silence, speaking what was always in his heart since the search \\nhad begun many decades ago. ‘Shiva, we are truly sorry for what has been done. You have \\nevery right to be angry. Lying is not our way. I think what was done is appalling and Lord Ram \\nwould have never condoned this. No matter how serious our troubles, we have no right to deceive \\nsomeone into helping us. I am deeply sorry’ \\n\\nShiva raised his eyebrow a bit. \\n\\nParvateshwar is the only one apologising instead of making excuses. He is a true follower of \\nthe great king Ram’s way \\n\\nShiva smiled. \\n\\nDaksha let out an audible sigh of relief. \\n\\nShiva turned towards Daksha. ‘Let us put this in the past, your Highness. Lite I said, there are \\nsome things about your nation that could be improved. No doubt about that. But it is amongst the \\nbest societies that I have seen. And it is worth fighting for. But I have a few conditions.’ \\n\\n‘Of course, my Lord,’ said Daksha, eager to please. \\n\\n‘At this point of time, I am not saying that I can perform the tasks that you expect of me nor \\nam I saying that I cannot do it. All I am saying is that I will try my best. But before that, I want to \\nunderstand more of your society before I can be sure of how I can help. I am assuming that \\nnothing will be hidden from me nor will I be misled.’ \\n\\n‘Of course, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘Secondly, you still need immigrants to expand your population. But you should not mislead \\nthem. I think that you should tell them the entire truth about Meluha and let them mate an \\ninformed decision on whether to come here. Or you don’t invite them at all. Is that fair?’ \\n\\n‘Of course it is, my Lord,’said Daksha. Nodding briefly towards Kanakhala, he committed, \\n‘We will implement that immediately.’ \\n\\n‘Furthermore, it is clear to me that I am not going back to Kashmir. Can my tribe, the Gunas, \\nbe brought to Devagiri? I would like them to be with me.’ \\n\\n‘Of course, my Lord,’ said Daksha with a quick look at Kanakhala. ‘Instructions will be sent \\ntoday itself to bring them to Devagiri.’ \\n\\n‘Also, I would like to visit the location where you manufacture the Somras. I would like to \\nunderstand this drink of the gods. Something tells me that it is important to do so.’ \\n\\n‘Of course you may, my Lord,’said Daksha, his face finally breaking into a nervous smile. \\n‘Kanakhala will take you there tomorrow itself. In fact, my family is also scheduled for a visit \\nthere day after tomorrow for a puja at the Brahma temple. Perhaps we could meet there.’ \\n\\n‘That would be nice,’said Shiva smiling. Then taking a deep breath he added, ‘And lastly, I \\nguess that you would like to announce the arrival of the Neelkanth to your people.’ \\n\\nDaksha and Kanakhala nodded hesitantly. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘I would life to request that you don’t do that for now.’ \\n\\nDaksha and Kanakhala’s face fell immediately. Nandi’s eyes were glued to the floor. He had \\nstopped listening to the conversation. The enormity of his prevarication was tearing him apart. \\n\\n‘Your Highness, I have a terrible feeling that when people know I am the Neelkanth, every \\naction and word of mine will be over-interpreted and over—analysed,’explained Shiva. ‘I am \\nafraid that I don’t know enough about your society or my task to be able to handle that at this point \\nof time.’ \\n\\n‘I understand my Lord,’said Daksha, willing a broken smile back on his face. You have my \\nword. Only my immediate staff, my family and the people you allow will know of the \\nNeelkanth’s arrival. Nobody else.’ \\n\\n‘Thankyou, your Highness. But I will say it again: I am a simple tribal man who just happened \\nto get a blue throat because of some exotic medicine. Honesdy, I still don’t know what one man \\nlike me can do in the face of the odds that you face.’ \\n\\n‘And I’ll say it again my Lord,’said Daksha, with a child-like smile. ‘If that man is you, he can \\nchange the entire universe!’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 \\n\\n\\nDrink of the Gods \\n\\n\\nShiva and Nandi were walking backto the royal guest house. Shiva had decided he wanted to eat \\nlunch alone. Nandi walked a few steps behind, his head bowed in self-recrimination. ‘My Lord, I \\nam so sorry ’ \\n\\nShiva turned around to gaze at Nandi. \\n\\n‘You are right, my Lord. We were so lost in our own troubles and the search for the Neelkanth \\nthat we didn’t realise the unfairness of our actions on immigrants. I misled you my Lord. I lied to \\nyou.’ \\n\\nShiva didn’t say anything. He continued to stare intensely into Nandi’s eyes. \\n\\n‘I am so sorry my Lord. I have failed you. I will accept whatever punishment you give me.’ \\n\\nShiva’s bps broke into a very faint smile. He patted Nandi lightly on his shoulders, signalling he \\nhad forgiven him. But his eyes delivered a clear message. ‘Never lie to me again, my friend.’ \\n\\nNandi nodded and whispered, ‘Never, my Lord. I am so sorry ’ \\n\\n‘Forget it Nandi,’ said Shiva, his smile a little broader now. ‘It’s in the past.’ \\n\\nThey turned and continued walking. Suddenly Shiva shook his head and chuckled slighdy. \\n‘Strange people!’ \\n\\n‘What is it, my Lord?’ asked Nandi. \\n\\n‘Nothing really. I was just wondering at some of the interesting things about your society.’ \\n\\n‘Interesting, my Lord?’ asked Nandi, feeling a little more confident now that Shiva was speaking \\nto him again. \\n\\n‘Well, some people in your country thinkjust the presence of my blue throat can help you \\nachieve impossible tasks. Some people actually think that my name has suddenly become so holy \\nthat they can’t even speak it.’ \\n\\nNandi smiled slightly. \\n\\n‘On the other hand,’continued Shiva, ‘some people clearly think that I am not required. In fact, \\nthey even think that my touching them is so polluting that I need to get a shudhikaran done! ’ \\n\\n‘Shudhikaran? Why would you need that my Lord?’ asked Nandi, a little concerned. \\n\\nShiva weighed his words carefully. ‘Well, I touched someone. And I was told that I would need \\nto undergo a shudhikaran.’ \\n\\n‘What? Who did you touch my Lord? Was it a vikarma person?’asked a troubled Nandi. ‘Only \\nthe touch of a vikarma person would mean that you would need to get a shudhikaran.’ \\n\\nShiva’s face abruptly changed colour. A veil lifted from his eyes. He suddenly understood the \\n\\n\\n\\nsignificance of the events of the previous day. Her hasty withdrawal at being touched. The \\nshocked reactions from the Guruji and Krittika. \\n\\n‘Go back to the guest house, Nandi. I will see you there,’said Shiva, as he turned towards the \\nguest house garden. \\n\\n‘My Lord, what happened?’asked Nandi, trying to keep pace with Shiva. ‘Did you get the \\nshudhikaran done or not?’ \\n\\n‘Go to the guest house Nandi,’ said Shiva walking rapidly away. ‘I will see you there.’ \\n\\n— - \\n\\nShiva waited for the larger part of an hour. But it was in vain, for Sati did not make an \\nappearance. He sat on the bench by himself, cursing the moment when that terrible thought had \\nentered his mind. \\n\\nHow could I have even thought that Sati would find my touch polluting? I am such a bloody \\nidiot! \\n\\nHe replayed moments of that fateful encounter in his mind and analysed every facet of it. \\n\\n‘If something happened to you, I would never be able to forgive myself.’ \\n\\nWhat did she mean by saying that? Does she have feelings for me? Or is she just an \\nhonourable woman who can’t bear to be the cause of someone else’s misfortune? And why \\nshould she think of herself as inferior? This entire concept of the vikarma is so damned ridiculous! \\n\\nRealising that she wasn’t going to come, Shiva got up. He kicked the bench hard, getting a \\npainful reminder that his once numb toe had got its sensation back Cursing out loud, he started \\nwalking backto the guest house. Walking past the stage, he noticed that there was something lying \\non the dance floor. He went closer and bent down to pick it up. It was her bead bracelet. He had \\nseen it on her right hand. The string did not seem broken. \\n\\nHad she purposely dropped it here? \\n\\nHe smelt it. It had the fragrance of the holy late on a sun-kissed evening. He brought it \\ndelicately to his lips and kissed it gently. Smiling, he dropped the bracelet into the pouch tied \\naround his waist. He would come back from Mount Mandar and meet her. He had to meet her. \\nHe would pursue her to the end of the world if required. He would fight the entire human race to \\nhave her. His journey in this life was incomplete without her. His heart knew it. His soul knew it. \\n\\n— — \\n\\n\\n‘How much further is it, Madam Prime Minister?’ asked Nandi, behaving like an excited child. \\n\\n\\n\\nA visit to the mythical Mount Mandar, the hub where the drink of the gods was manufactured, \\nwas a rare honour for any Meluhan. For most Sury avanshis, Mount Mandar was the soul of their \\nempire, for as long as it was safe, so was the Somras. \\n\\n‘It’s only been an hour since we left Devagiri, Captain,’said Kanakhala smiling. ‘It’s a day’s \\njourney to Mount Mandar.’ \\n\\n‘Actually because of the blinds on the carriage windows, I can’t see anything outside. And I \\ncan’t tell how much time has gone by since I can’t see the Sun either. That’s why I was asking’ \\n\\n‘The prahar lamp is right behind you, Captain. The blinds are down for your own protection.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled at Kanaldiala. He could understand that the blinds were not for their protection, but \\nfor the safety of Mount Mandar. To keep its location secret. Very few people knew of its exact \\nlocation. There was an elite team of soldiers called the Arishtanemi who protected the road to \\nMount Mandar and the travellers on it. Except for the scientists of Mount Mandar, the Arishtanemi \\nand any person authorised by the Emperor, nobody was allowed to the mountain or to know its \\nlocation. If the Chandravanshi terrorists attacked Mount Mandar, all would be lost for Meluha. \\n\\n‘Who would we be meeting there, Kanaldiala?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘My Lord, we would be meeting Brahaspati. He is the Chief Scientist of the empire. He leads \\nthe team of scientists who manufacture the Somras for the entire country. Of course, they also \\nconduct research in many other fields. A bird courier has already been sent to him informing \\nhim of your arrival. We will be meeting him tomorrow morning.’ \\n\\n‘Shiva nodded slightly, smiled at Kanaldiala, and said, Thankyou.’ \\n\\nAs Nandi looted at the prahar lamp again, Shiva went back to his book It was an interesting \\nmanuscript about the terrible war that was fought many thousands of years ago, between the \\nDevas, the gods; and the Asuras, the demons — an eternal struggle between opposites: good and \\nevil. The Devas, with the help of Lord Rudra, the Mahadev, the God of Gods, had destroyed the \\nAsuras and established righteousness in the world again. \\n\\n— Asm® — \\n\\n‘I hope you slept well, my Lord,’said Kanaldiala as she welcomed Shiva and Nandi into the \\nchamber outside Brahaspati’s office. \\n\\nIt was the beginning of the last hour of the first prahar. Days began early at Mount Mandar. \\n\\n‘Yes, I did,’ said Shiva. Though there was a strange rhythmic sound on through the night’ \\n\\nKanaldiala smiled but did not offer any explanation. She bowed her head and opened the door \\nto let Shiva into Brahaspati’s office. Shiva waited in followed by Kanakhala and Nandi. There \\nwere various strange instruments spread throughout Brahaspati’s large office, neatly organised on \\ntables of different heights. There were palm leaf notes alongside each of the instruments where \\nsome experiments had clearly been conducted. The room was a restrained blue. There was a \\nlarge picture window in the corner which afforded a breathtaking view of the dense forest at the \\nfoot of the mountain. At the centre, many simple, low seats had been arranged together in a \\n\\n\\n\\nsquare. It was a frugal room, in line with a culture that celebrated simplicity over style at every \\nturn. \\n\\nBrahaspati was standing in the centre of the room, his hands folded in a namaste. Of medium \\nheight, much shorter than Shiva, his wheat-coloured skin, deep set eyes and well-manicured \\nbeard gave Brahaspati a distinguished appearance. A clean shaven head, except for the choti and \\na serene expression, gave his face an intellectual look. His body was slightly overweight. His \\nbroad shoulders and barrel chest would have been markedly pronounced if they had been \\nexercised a bit, but Brahaspati’s body was a vehicle for his intellect and not the temple that it is to \\na warrior or Kshatriya. Brahaspati wore a typical white cotton dhoti and an angvastram draped \\nloosely over his shoulders. He wore a janau tied from his left shoulder down to the right side of \\nhis hips. \\n\\n‘How are you Kanaldiala?’ asked Brahaspati. ‘It has been a long time.’ \\n\\n‘Yes it has, Brahaspati,’ said Kanakhala, greeting Brahaspati with a namaste and a low bow. \\n\\nShiva noticed that the second amulet on Brahaspati’s arm showed him as a swan. A very select \\nchosen-tribe among Brahmins. \\n\\n‘This is Lord Shiva,’ said Kanaldiala, pointing towards Shiva. \\n\\n‘Just Shiva will do, thankyou,’ smiled Shiva, with a polite namaste towards Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘Alright then. Just Shiva it is. And, who might you be?’ asked Brahaspati, turning towards Nandi. \\n\\n‘This is Captain Nandi,’ answered Kanaldiala. ‘Lord Shiva’s aide.’ \\n\\n‘A pleasure to meet you, Captain,’said Brahaspati, before turning back to Shiva. ‘I don’t mean \\nto sound rude Shiva. But would it be possible for me to see your throat’ \\n\\nShiva nodded. As he took off his cravat, Brahaspati came forward to examine the throat. His \\nsmile disappeared as he saw Shiva’s throat radiating a bright blue hue. Brahaspati was speechless \\nfor a few moments. Slowly gathering his wits, he turned towards Kanakhala. ‘This is not a fraud. \\nThe colour comes from the inside. How is this possible? This means that...’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Kanaldiala softly, with a happiness that seemed to emanate from deep inside. ‘It \\nmeans the Neelkanth has come. Our saviour has come.’ \\n\\n‘Well, I don’t know if I am a saviour or anything like that,’said an embarrassed Shiva, retying \\nthe cravat around his throat. ‘But I will certainly try my best to help your wonderful country. It is \\nfor this reason that I come to you. Something tells me that it is important for me to know how the \\nSomras works.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati still seemed to be in a daze. He continued to watch Shiva but his attention seemed \\nelsewhere. He appeared to be working out the implications of the true Neelkanth’s arrival. \\n\\n‘Brahaspati...’ said Kanakhala, as she tried to call the chief scientist backinto the here and now. \\n\\n‘Huh!’ \\n\\n‘Can you tell me how the Somras works, Brahaspati?’ asked Shiva again. \\n\\n‘Of course,’ said Brahaspati, as his eyes refocused on the people in front of him. Noticing \\nNandi he asked, ‘Is it alright to speak in front of the captain?’ \\n\\n‘Nandi has been my friend through my time in Meluha,’said Shiva. ‘I hope it is alright if he \\nstays here.’ \\n\\nNandi felt touched that his Lord still trusted him so openly. Nandi swore once again, on pain of \\ndeath, to never lie to his Lord. \\n\\n‘Whatever you say, Shiva,’ said Brahaspati, smiling warmly. \\n\\n\\n\\nShiva noticed that Brahaspati was not submissive or excessively deferential on discovering that \\nhe was the Neelkanth. Just like Parvateshwar, Brahaspati called Shiva by his name and not ‘My \\nLord’. However, Shiva felt that while Parvateshwar’s attitude was driven by a distrusting surliness, \\nBrahaspati’s was driven perhaps by an assured affability. \\n\\n‘Thankyou,’ smiled Shiva. ‘So, how does the Somras work?’ \\n\\n— Aom — \\n\\nThe royal procession moved slowly on the road to Mount Mandar. There was a pilot guard of \\none hundred and sixty cavalrymen who rode before the five royal carriages in columns of four \\nabreast. A rearguard of another one hundred and sixty rode behind the royal carriages, in a \\nsimilar formation. A side guard of forty each marched along the left and right flanks. Each \\ncarriage also had ten soldiers and five serving maids seated on the side supports. The soldiers \\nwere the legendary Arishtanemi, the most feared militia in all of India. \\n\\nThe five carriages were made of solid wood, with no windows or apertures, except for upward \\npointed slits at the top for ventilation. There was a grill in front, behind the rider, to allow in light \\nand air and this could be shut instantly in case of an attack All the carriages were of exactly the \\nsame dimension and appearance, making it impossible to say which carriage carried the royal \\nfamily. If a person had divyadrishti, divine vision, to look beyond what human eyes could see, he \\nwould observe that the first, third and fourth carriages were empty. The second carried the royal \\nfamily — Daksha, his wife Veerini and his daughter Sati. The last carriage carried Parvateshwar \\nand some of his key brigadiers. \\n\\n‘Father, I still don’t understand why you insist on taking me along to pujas. I am not even \\nallowed to attend the main ceremony,’ said Sati. \\n\\n‘I have told you many times before,’smiled Daksha, as he patted Sati’s hand fondly. ‘None of \\nmy pujas are complete and pure till I have seen your face. I don’t care about the damned law.’ \\n\\n‘Father!’whispered Sati with an embarrassed smile and a slight, reproachful shake of her head. \\nShe knew it was wrong of her father to insult the law. \\n\\nSati’s mother, Veerini, looked at Daksha with an awkward smile. Then taking a quicklookat Sati, \\nreturned to her book \\n\\nAt a short distance from the royal procession, hidden by the dense forest, a small band of fifty \\nsoldiers slunk along silently. The soldiers wore light leather armour on their torso and had their \\ndhotis tied in military style to ensure ease of movement. Each of them bore two swords, a long \\nknife and had a hardshield made of metal and leather tied loosely around their back Their shoes \\nhad grooves to hold three small knives. At the head were two men. One of them, a handsome \\nyoung man with a battle scar embellishing his face, wore a dark brown turban which signified that \\nhe was the captain. His leather armour had been tied a little loose and a gold chain and pendant \\nhad slipped out carelessly. The pendant had a beautiful, white representation of a horizontal \\ncrescent moon, the Chandravanshi symbol. \\n\\n\\n\\nNext to him waited a giant of a man covered in a long robe from head to toe. A hood stitched \\nonto the robe was pulled up while his face was covered with a black mask Very Ettle of him was \\nvisible except for his strong fleshy hands and his expressionless, almond-shaped eyes. He had a \\nleather bracelet tied to his right wrist with the serpent Aum symbol embroidered on it. Without \\nturning to the captain, the hooded figure said, ‘Vishwadyumna, your mark is visible. Put it in and \\ntighten your armour.’ \\n\\nAn embarrassed Vishwadyumna immediately pushed the chain inside and puEed the two \\nstrings on the side of his shoulder to tighten the breastplate. \\n\\n‘My Lord, begging your pardon,’said Vishwadyumna. ‘But perhaps we could move ahead to \\nconfirm that this is the route to Mount Mandar. Once we know that, we’ll be sure that our \\ninformant was correct. I am sure that we can come back to kidnap her later. We are dangerously \\noutnumbered in any case. We can’t do anything right now.’ \\n\\nThe hooded figure replied calmly, ‘Vishwadyumna, have I ordered an attack? Where does the \\nquestion of us being outnumbered come in? And we are going in the direction of Mount Mandar. \\nA few hours delay will not bring the heavens down. For now, we follow.’ \\n\\nVishwadyumna swallowed hard. There was nothing he hated more than opposing his lord’s \\nviews. After all, it was his lord who had found the rare Suryavanshi sympathetic to their cause. \\nThis breakthrough would mate it possible for them to rip out and destroy the very heart of \\nMeluha. He spoke softly, ‘But my Lord, you know the Queen doesn’t like delays. There is unrest \\nbrewing amongst the men that perhaps the focus is being lost.’ \\n\\nThe hooded figure turned sharply. His body seemed to convey anger but his voice was \\ncomposed. ‘I am not losing focus. If you want to leave, please go. You will get your money. I \\nwill do this alone if I have to.’ \\n\\nShocked to see the rare show of emotion on his leader, Vishwadyumna retracted immediately. \\n‘No, my Lord. That is not what I was trying to imply. I am sorry. I will stay with you till you \\nrelease me. You are right. A few hours will mate no difference when we have waited for \\ncenturies.’ \\n\\nThe platoon continued tracking the royal caravan silendy. \\n\\n— - \\n\\n‘At a conceptual level, how the Somras works is ridiculously simple,’ said Brahaspati. ‘The \\nalmost impossible task was to convert the concept into reality. That was the genius of Lord \\nBrahma. Jai Shri Brahma!’ \\n\\n‘Jai Shri Brahma,’ repeated Shiva, Kanakhala and Nandi. \\n\\n‘Before understanding how the medicine slows down the ageing process dramatically, we have \\nto understand what keeps us alive,’said Brahaspati. ‘There is a fundamental thing that none of us \\ncan live without.’ \\n\\nShiva stared at Brahaspati, waiting for him to expound. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘And that fundamental thing is energy,’explained Brahaspati. ‘When we walk, talk, think, that is \\nwhen we do anything that can be called being alive, we use energy.’ \\n\\n‘We have a similar concept amongst our people,’ said Shiva. ‘Except, we call it Shakti.’ \\n\\n‘Shakti?’ asked a surprised Brahaspati. ‘Interesting. That word has not been used to describe \\nenergy for many centuries. It was a term of the Pandy as, the ancestors of all the people of India. \\nDo you know where your tribe came from? Their lineage?’ \\n\\n‘I am not really sure but there is an old woman in my tribe who claims to know everything \\nabout our history. Perhaps we should askher when she comes to Devagiri.’ \\n\\n‘Perhaps we should!’smiled Brahaspati. ‘In any case, getting back to the subject, we know \\nnothing can be done by our body without energy. Now where does this energy come from?’ \\n\\n‘From the food that we eat?’suggested Nandi, timidly. He was finally getting the confidence to \\nspeak in front of such important people. \\n\\n‘Absolutely right. The food that we eat stores energy, which we can expend. That’s also why if \\nwe don’t eat, we feel weak. However, you don’t get energy just by eating food. Something inside \\nthe body has to draw the energy so that we can put it to good use.’ \\n\\n‘Absolutely,’ agreed Shiva. \\n\\n‘The conversion of food into energy is done by the air we breathe,’continued Brahaspati. ‘The \\nair has various gases in it. One of these gases is called oxygen, which reacts with our food and \\nreleases energy. If we don’t get oxygen, our body would be starved of energy and we would die.’ \\n\\n‘But this is the process that keeps us alive,’said Shiva. ‘What does the medicine have to do with \\nit? The medicine has to work on that which causes us to grow old, become weaker and die.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled. ‘What I told you does have something to do with how we age. Because as it \\nappears, nature has a sense of humour. The very thing that keeps us alive is also what causes us to \\nage and eventually die. When oxygen reacts with our food to release energy, it also releases free \\nradicals called oxidants. These oxidants are toxic as well. When you leave any fruit out and it \\ngoes bad, it’s because it has been “oxidised” or the oxidants have reacted with it to make it rot. A \\nsimilar “oxidising process” causes metals to corrode. It happens especially with the new metal \\nwe have discovered — iron. The same thing happens to our body when we breathe in oxygen. \\nThe oxygen helps convert the food we eat into energy. But it also causes the release of oxidants \\ninto our body which start reacting inside us. We rust from the inside out, and hence age and die.’ \\n\\n‘By the holy god Agni! ’ exclaimed Nandi. ‘The very thing that gives us life also slowly kills us?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Brahaspati. ‘Thinkabout it. The body tries to store everything that you need from the \\noutside world to survive. It stores enough food so that even if you don’t eat for a few days you \\nwon’t die. It stocks up on water so that a few days of thirst will not kill you. It seems logical, right? \\nIf your body needs something, it keeps some of it as backup for possible shortages.’ \\n\\n‘Absolutely,’ agreed Shiva. \\n\\n‘On the other hand, the body does not store enough oxygen, the most crucial component of \\nstaying alive, to last for more than just a few minutes. It doesn’t mate sense at all. The only \\nexplanation can be that the body realises that despite being an elixir, oxygen is also a poison. \\nHence it is dangerous to store.’ \\n\\n‘So, what did Lord Brahma do?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘After a lot of research, Lord Brahma invented the Somras, which when consumed, reacts with \\nthe oxidants, absorbs them and then expels them from the body as sweat or urine. Because of the \\n\\n\\n\\nSomras, there are no oxidants left in the body ’ \\n\\n‘Is that why the sweat released from the body is poisonous the first time after a person drinks \\nthe Somras?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. Your sweat is particularly dangerous the first time after you drink the Somras. Having \\nsaid that, remember, sweat and urine released from the body even after a person has drunk the \\nSomras for years remains toxic. So you have to eject it from the body and make sure that it does \\nnot affect anyone else.’ \\n\\n‘So, that’s why the Meluhans are so obsessed with hygiene.’ \\n\\n‘Yes. That’s why all Meluhans are taught about two things from a young age — water and \\nhygiene. Water is the cleanest absorber of the effluents that the Somras generates and excretes as \\ntoxins. Meluhans are taught to drink gallons of water. And everything that can be washed, should \\nbe washed! The Meluhans bathe at least twice a day. All ablutions are done in specific rooms and \\nthe waste is carried out by underground drains safely out of the city ’ \\n\\n‘Strict hygiene standards!’ smiled Shiva, as he remembered his first day in Kashmir and \\nAyurvati’s strong words. ‘What goes into manufacturing the Somras?’ \\n\\n‘Manufacturing the Somras is not without its fair share of difficulties. It requires various \\ningredients that are not easily available. For example, the Sanjeevani tree. The empire has giant \\nplantations to produce these trees. The manufacturing procedure also generates a lot of heat. So \\nwe have to use a lot of water during the processing to keep the mixture stable. Also, the crushed \\nbranches of the Sanj eevani tree have to be churned with the waters of the Saraswati river before \\nprocessing begins. Water from other sources doesn’t work’ \\n\\n‘Is that the strange noise I keep hearing: the churners?’ \\n\\n‘That’s exacty what it is. We have giant churning machines in a massive cavern at the base of \\nthis mountain. The Saraswati waters are led in here through a complex system of canals. The \\nwater is collected in an enormous pool in the cavern which we affectionately call Sagar. ’ \\n\\n‘Sagar An ocean You call a pool of water by that name?’ asked a surprised Shiva, for he had \\nheard legends about the massive, never-ending expanse of water called Sagar. \\n\\n‘It is a bit of hyperbole,’admitted Brahaspati with a smile. ‘But if you did see the size of the \\npool, you would realise that we are not that off the mark! ’ \\n\\n‘Well I would certainly like to see the entire facility. It was too late when we came in last night \\nso I haven’t seen much of the mountain as yet.’ \\n\\n‘I will take you around after lunch,’ said Brahaspati. \\n\\nShiva grinned in reply. He was about to say something, but checked himself in time, looking at \\nboth Kanakhala and Nandi. \\n\\nBrahaspati noticed the hesitation. He felt Shiva might want to askhim something, but not in front \\nof Nandi and Kanakhala. Brahaspati turned to them and said, ‘I think Shiva wants to ask me \\nsomething. May I request you to wait outside?’ \\n\\nIt was a measure of the respect that Brahaspati commanded, that Kanakhala immediately rose \\nto leave the room after a formal namaste, followed by Nandi. Brahaspati turned to Shiva with a \\nsmile. ‘Why don’t you askme the real question you came to ask?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9 \\n\\n\\nLove and its Consequences \\n\\n‘I didn’t want to question you in front of them. Their faith is overwhelming,’ explained Shiva with \\na wry grin. He was beginning to like Brahaspati. He enjoyed being around a man who treated \\nhim like an equal. \\n\\nBrahaspati nodded. ‘I understand, my friend. What do you want to ask?’ \\n\\n‘Why me?’asked Shiva. Why did the Somras have this strange effect on me? I might have a \\nblue throat, but I don’t know how I am going to become the saviour of the Suryavanshis. The \\nEmperor tells me that I am supposed to be the one who will complete Lord Ram’s unfinished \\nworkand destroy the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘He told you that?’ asked Brahaspati, his eyes wide in surprise. ‘The Emperor can be a little \\ntiresome at times. But suffice it to say that what he told you is not completely correct. The legend \\ndoesn’t exactly say that the Neelkanth will save the Suryavanshis. The legend says two things. \\nFirst, that the Neelkanth will not be from the Sapt-Sindhu. And second, the Neelkanth will be the \\n“destroyer of evil”. The Meluhans believe that this implies that the Neelkanth will destroy the \\nChandravanshis, since they are obviously evil. But destroying the Chandravanshis doesn’t mean \\nthat the Suryavanshis will be saved! There are many other problems, besides the Chandravanshis, \\nthat we need to solve.’ \\n\\n‘What kind of problems? Lite the Nagas?’ \\n\\nBrahaspati seemed to hesitate for a moment. He replied carefully. ‘There are many problems. \\nWe are working hard to solve them. But coming back to your question, why did the Somras have \\nthis effect on you?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, why did it? Why did my throat turn blue? Forget about stopping the degeneration of my \\nbody, the Somras actually repaired a dislocated shoulder and a frostbitten toe.’ \\n\\n‘It repaired an injury?’asked an incredulous Brahaspati. ‘That’s impossible! It is just supposed \\nto prevent diseases and ageing, not repair inj uries.’ \\n\\n‘Well, it did in my case.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati thought for a bit. ‘We will have to do experiments to come up with a definitive \\nanswer. For now though, I can think of only one explanation. From what I know, you come from \\nthe high lands beyond the Himalayas, right?’ \\n\\nShiva nodded. \\n\\n‘The air gets thinner as you go higher up the mountains,’continued Brahaspati. ‘There is less \\noxygen in thinner air. That means your body was used to surviving with less oxygen and \\n\\n\\n\\nresultantiy was less harmed by the oxidants. Therefore the anti-oxidants in the Somras may have \\nhad a stronger effect on you.’ \\n\\n‘That could be one of the reasons,’agreed Shiva. ‘But if that was the case, the rest of my tribe \\nshould have also turned cold and blue. Why just me?’ \\n\\n‘A good point,’conceded Brahaspati. ‘But tell me one thing. Did your tribe also experience an \\nimprovement in their pre—existing conditions?’ \\n\\n‘Actually, yes they did.’ \\n\\n‘So maybe the diluted air you all lived in did have some role to play. But since all of your tribe \\ndid not develop blue throats, it is obvious that the “thinner air” theory may be a partial \\nexplanation. We can always research it more. I am sure there is a scientific explanation for the \\nblue throat.’ \\n\\nShiva looted at Brahaspati intently, as he read between the lines of Brahaspati’s last statement. \\n‘You don’t believe in the legend of the Neelkanth, do you?’ \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled at Shiva awkwardly. He was beginning to like Shiva and did not want to say \\nanything to insult him. But he wasn’t going to lie either. ‘I believe in science. It provides a solution \\nand a rationale for everything. And if there is anything that appears like a miracle, the only \\nexplanation is that a scientific reason for it has not been discovered as yet.’ \\n\\n‘Then why do the people of Meluha not look to science for solving their problems?’ \\n\\n‘I am not sure,’ said Brahaspati thoughtfully. ‘Perhaps it is because science is a capable but \\ncold-hearted master. Unlike a Neelkanth, it will not solve your problems for you. It will only \\nprovide you the tools that you may need to fight your own battles. Perhaps it is easier for people \\nto believe that someone else will come and solve their problems rather than solve it themselves.’ \\n\\n‘So what do you think is the role that the Neelkanth has to play in Meluha?’ \\n\\nBrahaspati looted at Shiva sympathetically. ‘I would like to think that true Suryavanshis should \\nfight their own demons rather than put pressure on someone else and expect him to solve their \\nproblems. A true Suryavanshi’s duty is to push himself to the limit of his abilities and strength. The \\ncoming of the Neelkanth should only redouble a Suryavanshi’s efforts, since it is obvious that the \\ntime for the destruction of evil is near.’ Shiva nodded. \\n\\n‘Are you concerned that it may be too much of a strain for you to take up a responsibility that \\nyou don’t really want, because of the pressure of faith?’ asked Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘No, that is not my concern,’replied Shiva. This is a wonderful country and I certainly want to \\ndo all I can to help. But what if your people depend on me to protect them and I can’t? Right now, \\nI can’t say that I can do all that is expected from me. So how can I give my word?’ \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled. According to his rule book, any man who took his own word seriously was \\nworth respecting. \\n\\n‘You appear to be a good man, Shiva. You will probably face a lot of pressure in the coming \\ndays. Be careful, my friend. Because of the blue throat and the blind faith it generates, your \\ndecisions will have ramifications for the entire land. Remember, whether a man is a legend or not \\nis decided by history, not fortune-tellers.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled, glad to have finally found a man who understood his predicament. And more \\nimportantly, was willing to at least offer some advice. \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\nIt was late in the evening. Having spent a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon on a detailed tour of \\nMount Mandar with Brahaspati, Shiva lay on his bed, reading a book A spent chillum lay on the \\nside table. \\n\\nA few aspects of the story he was reading, The Righteous War against the Asuras’, troubled \\nhim. The Asuras were demons and were expected to behave like demons, having a pathological \\nhatred for the Devas. They routinely attacked Deva cities, trying to force them to accept the \\nAsura way of life. This was not a surprise to Shiva. What was unexpected though was the way \\nsome of the Devas behaved, going to unusually unethical limits in their blind pursuit of victory. \\nLord Rudra, though personally a great man, seemed to ignore the indiscretions of the Devas in the \\ninterest of the larger good. \\n\\nShiva heard a commotion outside the Guest House. He looked out of his first floor balcony to \\nnotice that the royal caravan had just arrived. The Arishtanemi soldiers had formed a neat \\nsalutary row at the entrance. Some people appeared to be disembarking from the far side of the \\nsecond carriage. Shiva assumed it must be the royal family. The surprise was that the \\nArishtanemi seemed to be going through just the normal motions in receiving the royal family. \\nThere wasn’t the usual servitude that would be expected in front of royalty. Shiva suspected that \\nthis could be due to the usual Meluhan obsession with perceived equality. \\n\\nHowever, Shiva’s equality theory was challenged when he looted at the fifth carriage from \\nwhich Parvateshwar alit. Here, the Arishtanemi seemed to be in a tizzy. The senior captain \\nrushed in front of Parvateshwar and executed a Meluhan military salute — a quick click of the \\nheels, the body rigid in attention and the right hand, balled in a fist, brought rapidly and violently \\nto his left chest. After this salute, the captain bent low in respect to the chief of the army. The \\nsoldiers at the back repeated their captain’s greeting. Parvateshwar formally saluted in return, \\naccompanied with a slight bow of his head. \\n\\nHe started towards his soldiers, inspecting them, while the captain politely fell two steps behind. \\n\\nShiva had a feeling that the admiration reserved for Parvateshwar was not because of the post \\nhe held. It was for the man himself. For all his surliness, Parvateshwar had a reputation of a brave \\nwarrior, a soldier’s general respected as a man whose word was true. Shiva could see the strength \\nof that repute in the eyes of each Arishtanemi who bent low on receiving the attention of his \\ngeneral. \\n\\nA little while later, Shiva heard a soft knock on his door. He did not need to open it to know who \\nwas on the other side. Sighing sofdy, he opened the door. \\n\\nDaksha’s fixed smile disappeared and he started a litde as the unfamiliar odour of the \\nmarijuana assaulted his senses. Kanakhala, standing to the Emperor’s right, appeared equally \\nperplexed. \\n\\n‘What is that stench?’Daksha asked Brahaspati, who stood to the left. ‘Perhaps you should \\nchange the Lord’s room. How can you subject him to this discomfort?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘I have a feeling that Shiva is comfortable with this aroma, your Highness,’ said Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘It is a smell that travels with me, your Highness,’ said Shiva. ‘I like it.’ \\n\\nDaksha was baffled. His face did nothing to hide his revulsion. But he quickly recovered his \\ncomposure. After all, the Lord was happy with the malodour. ‘I’m sorry to disturb you, my \\nLord,’said Daksha, his smile backin place. ‘I had just thought I would inform you thatmy family \\nand I have reached the guest house.’ \\n\\n‘It’s very kind of you to inform me, your Highness,’ said Shiva with a formal namaste. \\n\\n‘My family and I were hoping to have the honour of eating breakfast with you tomorrow \\nmorning, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘The honour would be mine, your Highness.’ \\n\\n‘Excellent. Excellent,’beamed Daksha as he moved on to the question that dominated his mind. \\n‘What do you think of the Somras, my Lord? Isn’t it really the drink of the Gods?’ \\n\\n‘Yes your Highness. It does appear to be a miraculous drink’ \\n\\n‘It is the basis of our civilisation,’continued Daksha. ‘Once you have taken a tour of our land, \\nyou will see the goodness of our way of life. I am sure you will find it in your heart to do \\nsomething to save it.’ \\n\\n‘Your Highness, I already think highly of your country. It truly is great and treats its citizens \\nwell. I wouldn’t doubt that it is a way of life that is worth protecting. However, what I am not sure \\nabout is what I can do. Yours is such an advanced civilisation and I am just a simple tribal man.’ \\n\\n‘Faith is a very potent weapon, my Lord,’said Daksha, his hands joined in supplication. ‘All that \\nis needed is for you to have as much faith in yourself as we have in you. I am sure that if you \\nspend a few more days in our country and see the effect that your presence has on our people, \\nyou will realise what you can do.’ \\n\\nShiva gave up arguing against Daksha’s childlike belief. \\n\\nBrahaspati winked at Shiva before coming to his rescue. ‘Your Highness, Shiva looks tired to \\nme. It has been a long day. Maybe he should retire and we could meet tomorrow?’ \\n\\nDaksha smiled, ‘Perhaps you are right, Brahaspati. My apologies for troubling you, my Lord. \\nWe will see you at breakfast. Have a good night.’ \\n\\n‘Good night,’ wished Shiva in return. \\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nSati waited quietly at the table as Daksha glanced nervously at the prahar lamp. To the left \\nwere Kanakhala, Brahaspati and Parvateshwar. To his right was an empty chair. For the \\n‘Neelkanth’, thought Sati. Next to the empty chair sat Sati and to her right was her mother, \\nVeerini. Daksha had agonised deeply over the seating to get it exactly right. \\n\\nSati looked over the arrangements. A formal table and chairs for breakfast rather than the \\npreferred low table and floor cushions that Meluhans normally sat upon to eat. The beloved \\nbanana leaf had been replaced by gold plates. The taste enhancing kulhads, or mud cups, had \\n\\n\\n\\nbeen replaced by refined silver glasses. She thought that her father was really pulling out all stops \\nfor this breakfast meeting. She had seen him pin his hopes on too many so-called Neelkanths \\nearlier. Miracle men who had turned out to be frauds. She hoped that her father would not have to \\nface disillusionment again. \\n\\nThe crier announced Shiva and Nandi. As Daksha rose with a reverential namaste to receive \\nthe Lord, Parvateshwar rolled his eyes at the servile behaviour of his Emperor. At the same \\ninstant, Sati bent down to pickup a glass that she had accidentally knocked over to the floor. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’said Daksha pointing to the people standing around the table. ‘Kanakhala, Brahaspati \\nand Parvateshwar, you already know. At the far right is my wife, Queen Veerini.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled politely as he returned Veerini’s namaste with a formal namaste and a low bow. \\n\\n‘And next to her,’ said Daksha with a broad smile as Sati came up holding the glass she had \\nretrieved, ‘is my daughter, Princess Sati.’ \\n\\nThe breath went out of Shiva as he looted at his life staring back at him. His heart beat a frantic \\nrhythm. He could swear that he had a whiff of his favourite fragrance in the world: the aroma of \\nthe holy late at sunset. As before, he was mesmerized. \\n\\nThere was an uncomfortable silence in the room. Except for the noise made by the unfortunate \\nglass which fell from Sati’s hand again. The clang of the rolling glass distracted Sati slightly from \\nher fixed gaze. With superhuman effort, she managed to control the look of shock on her face. \\nShe was breathing heavily, as if she had j ust danced a duet with Shiva. What she did not know was \\nthat her soul was doing exactly that. \\n\\nDaksha gazed at the dumbstruck couple with glee. He had the look of a director who had just \\nseen his play being perfectly executed. Nandi, standing right behind Shiva, could see Sati’s \\nexpression. Suddenly everything became clear to him. The dance practices, the vikarma touch, \\nthe shudhikaran and his Lord’s anguish. While some part of him was afraid, another reconciled to \\nit quickly. If his Lord wanted this, he would support it in every way possible. Brahaspati stared \\nblankly at the couple, deep in thought about the implications of this unexpected situation. \\nParvateshwar looted at the goings on with barely concealed repugnance. What was happening \\nwas wrong, immoral and worst of all, illegal. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’said Daksha pointing to the empty seat at his right. ‘Please take your seat and we \\nshall begin.’ \\n\\nShiva did not react. He had not heard Daksha’s words. He was in a world where the only sound \\nwas the harmonious melody of Sati’s heavy breathing. A tune he could blissfully dance to for his \\nnext seven lives. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ repeated Daksha, a litde louder. \\n\\nA distracted Shiva finally looted at Daksha, as if from another world. \\n\\n‘Please take your seat, my Lord,’ said Daksha. \\n\\n‘Yes of course, your Highness,’ said Shiva averting his eyes in embarrassment. \\n\\nAs Shiva sat down, the food was brought in. It was a simple delicacy that the Meluhans loved \\nfor breakfast. Rice and some cereals fermented and ground into a thick batter. Small portions of \\nthis batter were then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed into cylindrical roundels. The \\npreparation was served while still draped in the banana leaf, along with some spicy lentils for \\ntaste. The dish was called an idli. \\n\\n‘You’re the Neelkanth?’a still shocked Sati whispered softly to Shiva, as she had willed some \\n\\n\\n\\ncalmness into her breathing. \\n\\n‘Apparently so,’ replied Shiva with a playful grin. ‘Impressed?’ \\n\\nSati answered that question with a raised disdainful brow. The maskwas back ‘Why would I be \\nimpressed?’ \\n\\nWhat?! \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ said Daksha. \\n\\n‘Yes, your Highness,’ said Shiva, turning towards Daksha. \\n\\n‘I was thinking,’said Daksha. ‘Our puja should be over by this evening. Yet I have to stay here \\nfor two more days for some reviews with Brahaspati. There is no point in having Veerini and Sati \\nget thoroughly bored out here for so much time.’ \\n\\n‘Thank you, your Highness,’said Brahaspati with a sly grin. ‘Your vote of confidence in the \\ninterest that the royal family has in Mount Mandar is most reassuring.’ \\n\\nThe entire table burst out laughing. So did Daksha, exhibiting a sporting spirit. \\n\\n‘You know what I meant Brahaspati!’said Daksha, shaking his head. Turning back to Shiva, he \\ncontinued, ‘From what I know, my Lord, you were planning to leave for Devagiri tomorrow \\nmorning. I think it may be a good idea for Veerini and Sati to accompany you. The rest of us can \\ncatch up with you two days later.’ \\n\\nSati looked up in alarm. She wasn’t sure why, but something told her that she shouldn’t agree to \\nthis plan. Another part of her said that she had no reason to be scared. In all the eighty-five years \\nshe had spent as a vikarma, she had never broken the law. She had the self-control to know what \\nwas right, and what wasn’t. \\n\\nShiva though had no such thoughts. With very obvious delight, he said, ‘I think that is a very \\ngood idea, your Highness. Nandi and I could travel with both her Highnesses backto Devagiri.’ \\n\\n‘It’s settled then,’ said a visibly content Daksha. Turning to Parvateshwar, he said, \\n‘Parvateshwar, please ensure that the Arishtanemi escort are broken up into two groups for the \\nreturn journey.’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, I don’t think that is wise,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘A large part of the Arishtanemi are still \\nin Devagiri preparing for the material transfer. Also, the standing contingent in Mount Mandar \\ncannot be reduced under any circumstances. We may not have enough soldiers for two \\ncaravans. Perhaps, we could all travel together day after tomorrow’ \\n\\n‘I am sure there won’t be a problem,’ said Daksha. ‘And don’t you always say that each \\nArishtanemi is equal to fifty enemy soldiers? It’s settled. The Lord Neelkanth, Veerini and Sati \\nwill leave tomorrow morning. Please make all the arrangements.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar went unhappily back to his thoughts as Shiva and Sati started whispering to each \\nother again. \\n\\n‘You did go for a shudhikaran, didn’t you?’ asked Sati seriously. \\n\\n‘Yes,’said Shiva. He wasn’t lying. He had gone for a purification ceremony on his last night at \\nDevagiri. He didn’t believe he needed it. However, he knew that Sati would ask him the next time \\nthey met. And he didn’t want to lie to her. \\n\\n‘Though I think the concept of doing a shudhikaran is completely absurd,’whispered Shiva. ‘In \\nfact, the entire concept of the vikarma is ridiculous. I think that is one of the few things in Meluha \\nthat is not fair and should be changed.’ \\n\\nSati looted up suddenly at Shiva, her face devoid of any expression. Shiva stared hard into her \\n\\n\\n\\neyes, trying to gauge some of the thoughts running through her mind. But he hit a blank wall. \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt was the beginning of the second prahar the next day when Shiva, Veerini, Sati and Nandi \\ndeparted for Devagiri along with a hundred Arishtanemi. Daksha, Parvateshwar and Kanakhala \\nstood outside the guest house to see them off. Brahaspati had been detained by some scheduled \\nexperiments. \\n\\nThe entourage had to sit in the same carriage as there were guidelines that a minimum of four \\ncarriages had to be kept aside for any caravan that carried the Emperor. Since the royal \\nprocession had come in five carriages, that left only one carriage for this caravan. Parvateshwar \\nwas deeply unhappy about the unorthodox way in which members of the royal family had to \\ntravel without any dummy carriages, but his objections were overruled by Daksha. \\n\\nSitting on one of the comfortable sofas inside the carriage, Sati noticed that Shiva was wearing \\nhis cravat again. ‘Why do you cover your throat all the time?’ \\n\\n‘I am uncomfortable with the attention that comes when anyone sees the blue throat,’replied \\nShiva. \\n\\n‘But you will have to get used to it. The blue throat is not going to disappear.’ \\n\\n‘True,’ answered Shiva with a smile. ‘But till I get used to it, the cravat is my shield.’ \\n\\nAs the caravan left, Parvateshwar and Kanakhala came up to Daksha. \\n\\n‘Why do you have so much faith in that man, my Lord?’asked Parvateshwar of Daksha. ‘He \\nhas done nothing to deserve respect. How can he lead us to victory when he has not even been \\ntrained for it? The entire concept of the Neelkanth goes against our rules. In Meluha a person is \\nsupposed to be given a task only if he is found capable of it and trained by the system.’ \\n\\n‘We are in a state of war, Parvateshwar,’replied Daksha. ‘An undeclared one, but a state of \\nwar all the same. We face a terrorist attack every other week These cowardly Chandravanshis \\ndon’t even attack from the front so that we can fight them. And our army is too small to attack \\ntheir territory openly. Our “rules” are not working. We need a miracle. And the first rule of \\nserendipity is that miracles come when we forget rational laws and have faith. I have faith in the \\nNeelkanth. And so do my people.’ \\n\\n‘But Shiva has no faith in himself. How can you force him to be our saviour when he himself \\ndoesn’t want to do it?’ \\n\\n‘Sati will change that.’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, you are going to use your own daughter as bait?’ asked a horrified Parvateshwar. \\nAnd do you really want a saviour who decides to help us j ust because of his lust! ’ \\n\\n‘IT IS NOT LUST!’ \\n\\nParvateshwar and Kanakhala kept quiet, shocked by Daksha’s reaction. \\n\\n‘What kind of a father do you think I am?’ asked Daksha. You think I will use my daughter so? \\nShe just may find comfort and happiness with the Lord. She has suffered enough already. I want \\n\\n\\n\\nher to be happy. And if in doing so, I help my country as well, what is the harm?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar was about to say something, but thought the better of it. \\n\\n‘We need to destroy the Chandravanshi ideology,’continued Daksha. ‘And the only way we \\ncan do that is if we can give the benefits of our lifestyle to the people of Swadweep. The common \\nSwadweepans will be grateful for this, but their Chandravanshi rulers will try everything in their \\npower to stop us. They may be able to resist us, but try as they might, they cannot stop a people \\nled by the Neelkanth. And if Sati is with the Neelkanth, there is no way he would refuse to lead us \\nagainst the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘But your Highness, do you really think the Lord would come to our side just because he is in \\nlove with your daughter?’ asked Kanakhala. \\n\\n‘You have missed the point. The Lord does not need to be convinced to be on our side,’said \\nDaksha. ‘He already is. We are a great civilisation. Maybe not perfect, but great all the same. \\nOne has to be blind to not see that. What the Neelkanth needs is the motivation and belief in \\nhimself to lead us. That belief in himself will assert itself when he moves closer to Sati.’ \\n\\n‘And how is that going to happen, your Highness?’ asked Parvateshwar, frowning slightly. \\n\\n‘You know what is the most powerful force in a man’s life?’ asked Daksha. \\n\\nKanakhala and Parvateshwar looked at Daksha nonplussed. \\n\\n‘It is his intense desire to impress the person he loves most,’expounded Daksha. ‘Look at me. I \\nhave always loved my father. My desire to impress him is what is driving me even today. Even \\nafter his death, I still want to make him proud of me. It is driving me to my destiny as the King \\nwho will re-establish the pure Suryavanshi way of life across India. And when the Neelkanth \\ndevelops a deep desire to mate Sati proud of him, he will rise to fulfil his destiny.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar frowned, not quite agreeing with the logic, but kept quiet all the same. \\n\\n‘But what if Sati seeks something different?’ asked Kanakhala. ‘Lite a husband who spends all \\nhis time with her.’ \\n\\n‘I know my daughter,’ replied Daksha confidendy. ‘I know what it takes to impress her.’ \\n\\n‘That’s an interesting point of view, my Lord,’smiled Kanakhala. ‘Just out of curiosity, what do \\nyou think is the most powerful force in a woman’s life?’ \\n\\nDaksha laughed out loud. ‘Why do you ask? Don’t you know?’ \\n\\n‘Well the most powerful force in my life is the desire to get out of the house before my \\nmother-in-law wakes up!’ \\n\\nBoth Daksha and Kanakhala guffawed loudly. \\n\\nParvateshwar didn’t seem to find it funny. ‘I am sorry but that is no way to speak about your \\nmother-in-law.’ \\n\\n‘Oh relax, Parvateshwar,’ said Kanakhala. ‘You take everything too seriously’ \\n\\n‘I think,’said Daksha smiling, ‘the most powerful force in a woman’s life is the need to be \\nappreciated, loved and cherished for what she is.’ \\n\\nKanakhala smiled and nodded. Her emperor truly understood human emotions. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10 \\n\\n\\nThe Hooded Figure Returns \\n\\nAs the caravan emerged from the carefully chiselled passage leading out from the depths of \\nMount Mandar, Veerini requested that the carriage be stopped for a minute. Veerini, Sati, Shiva \\nand Nandi went down on their knees and offered a short prayer to the mountain for its continued \\nbenefaction. Watching over them on high alert was the Arishtanemi Bhabravya, a strapping man \\nof sixty years with an intimidating moustache and beard. \\n\\nAfter a short while, Bhabravya came up to Veerini and said with barely concealed impatience: \\n‘Your Highness, perhaps it’s time to get backinto the carriage.’ \\n\\nVeerini looked up at the captain and with a quicknod got up. Sati, Shiva and Nandi followed. \\n\\n— Adm® - \\n\\n‘It’s her,’ said Vishwadyumna putting down the scope and turning towards his Lord. \\n\\nThe platoon was at a safe distance, concealed from the caravan. The dense and impenetrable \\nfoliage was an effective shield. \\n\\n‘Yes’, said the hooded figure and let his eyes linger on Shiva’s muscular body. Even without \\nusing the scope he was in no doubt that this was the same man who had fought him at the Brahma \\ntemple some weeks ago. ‘Who is that man?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘Keep your eye on him. He was the one who foiled the last attack.’ \\n\\nVishwadyumna wanted to say that the previous attempt failed because it was unplanned. The \\npresence of the caste-unmarked man had litde role to play. Vishwadyumna could not understand \\nthe recent irrational decisions of his Lord. It was unlike him. Perhaps it was the closeness of the \\nultimate objective that was clouding his judgement. Vishwadyumna was, however, wise enough \\nto keep his thoughts to himself. ‘Perhaps we could track them for around an hour before we attack, \\nmy Lord. It will be a safe distance from the Arishtanemi back-up. We can get this over with \\nquickly and report backto the Queen that the informer was correct’ \\n\\n“No, we’ll wait for a few hours more when they are at least a half day’s distance from Mount \\n\\n\\n\\nMandar. Their new carriages have systems that can send an emergency signal immediately. We \\nneed to ensure our task is done before back-up arrives.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’said Vishwadyumna, happy to see that his Lord’s famed tactical brilliance had \\nnot diminished. \\n\\n‘And, remember, I want it done quickly,’added the hooded figure. ‘The more time we take, the \\nmore people get hurt.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\nIt was the beginning of the third prahar when the caravan stopped at the half-way clearing for \\nlunch. Here the forest had been cut backto a distance that made a surprise attack impossible. The \\nQueen’s maids quickly unpacked the food and started heating it in the centre of the clearing. The \\nroyal party and Shiva were sitting closer to the head of the caravan, in the direction towards \\nDevagiri. Bhabravya stood on the higher ground in the rear, keeping an eagle eye on the \\nsurroundings. Apart from the royal party, half the Arishtanemi soldiers had also sat down to eat \\nwhile the others kept watch. \\n\\nShiva was about take a second helping of rice when he heard the crack of a twig down the road. \\nStopping mid-way, he listened intently for another sound. There was none. His instincts told him \\nthis was a predator, who realising he had made a mistake, was now keeping still. Shiva looked over \\nat Sati to see if she had heard the sound. She too was staring intently down the road. There was a \\nsoft crunch as the foot on the broken twig eased its pressure slightly. It would have been missed \\nby most, except a focussed listener. \\n\\nShiva immediately put his plate down, pulled out his sword and fixed his shield on his back \\nBhabravya saw Shiva across the caravan and drew his sword as well, giving quick, silent signals to \\nhis men to do the same. The Arishtanemi were battle ready in a matter of seconds. Sati and \\nNandi too pulled out their swords and got into traditional fighter positions. \\n\\nSati whispered to Veerini without turning, ‘Mother, please sit in the carriage and lock it. Tate the \\nmaids in too. But get them to disconnect the horses from the carriage first We are not retreating \\nand we don’t want the enemy kidnapping you either.’ \\n\\n‘Come with me Sati,’ pleaded Veerini as her maids rushed to pull out the holds on the carriage. \\n\\n‘No, I’m staying here. Please hurry. We may not have much time.’ \\n\\nVeerini rushed into the carriage followed by the maids who quickly locked it from the inside. \\n\\nAt a distance, Bhabravya whispered to his aide. ‘I know their tactics. I have seen these cowards \\non the southern border. They will send an advance suicide party, pretend to retreat and draw us \\ninto a stronghold. I don’t care about the losses. We will chase those bastards and destroy every \\nsingle one of them. They have run into the Arishtanemi. They will pay for this mistake.’ \\n\\nShiva, meanwhile, turned to Sati and whispered carefully, ‘I think they must be aiming for a \\nhigh profile target. Nothing would be more significant than the royal family. Do you think that \\n\\n\\n\\nyou too should wait in the carriage?’ \\n\\nSati’s eyes darted up at Shiva in surprise. A pained lookcrossed her face before being replaced \\nby a defiant glare. ‘I am going to fight...’ \\n\\nWhat’s wrong with her?! What I said is completely logical. Make the main objective of the \\nenemy difficult to get at and they will lose the will to fight. \\n\\nShiva pushed these thoughts out of his mind to focus on the road. The rest of the caravan \\nstrained every nerve to Esten intentiy for any movement from the enemy. They were prepared \\nfor the ambush. It was the enemy’s turn to mate a move. Just as they thought that it may have \\nbeen a false alarm, the sound of a conch shell reverberated from down the road — from the \\ndirection of Mount Mandar. Shiva turned around but did not move. Whatever was making the \\nnoise was moving rapidly towards them. \\n\\nShiva could not recognise the cacophonic sound. However, the Arishtanemi from the southern \\nborder knew exactly what it was. That was the sound of a Nagadhvani conch. It was blown to \\nannounce the launch of a Naga attack! \\n\\nThough impatient to fight, Bhabravya did not forget the standard operating procedures. He \\nordered an aide, who rushed to the carriage and pulled out a red box fixed at the bottom. Kicking \\nit open, the aide pressed a button on the side. A tubular chimney-like structure extended straight \\nup from the box for nearly twenty-five feet. The chimney ensured that the smote signal was not \\nlost in the dense forest and could be seen by the scouts at both Devagiri and Mount Mandar. The \\nsoldier picked a branch from the fire and pushed it into the last of the four slots on the right side of \\nthe box. Red smote fumed out of the chimney, signifying the presence of the highest level of \\ndanger. Help was six hours away. Four, if the back-up rode hard. Bhabravya did not intend the \\nbattle to last that long. He intended to kill each of the Nagas and the Chandravanshis long before \\nthat. \\n\\nThen the attack began, from the side of the road leading to Mount Mandar. A small band of ten \\nChandravanshi soldiers charged at the Arishtanemi. One soldier was holding the Naga conch shell \\nand blowing hard. Another amongst them had covered his entire face and head with a cloth, \\nexcept for small slits for his eyes. The Naga himself! \\n\\nShiva did not move. He could see the battle raging at the far end of the caravan. There were \\nonly ten Chandravanshis. The Arishtanemi did not need any support. He signalled to \\n\\nSati and Nandi to stay where they were. Sati agreed for she too expected this attack to be a \\nruse. \\n\\nThe battle was short and fierce. The Chandravanshi soldiers fought viciously but were \\noutnumbered. As Bhabravya expected, they turned in no time and retreated fast. \\n\\n‘After them,’ yelled Bhabravya. ‘Kill them all.’ \\n\\nThe Arishtanemi dashed behind their captain in pursuit of the retreating Chandravanshis. Most \\nof them did not hear Shiva cry out loud. ‘No! Stay here. Don’t chase them.’ \\n\\nBy the time some of the Arishtanemi heard Shiva’s order, a majority had already left, chasing \\nthe Chandravanshis. Shiva was left in the clearing with Sati, Nandi and just twenty—five soldiers. \\nShiva turned backtowards the side of the road leading to Devagiri — the direction from which the \\ncrackof the twig had come. \\n\\nHe turned again to look at the remaining Arishtanemi. Pointing towards his back, he spoke with \\na voice that was both steady and calm, ‘This is where the actual attack will come from. Get into a \\n\\n\\n\\ntight formation in fours, facing that direction. Keep the princess in the middle. We will have to \\nhold them back for about five or ten minutes. The other Arishtanemi will return when they realise \\nthere are no Chandravanshis to fight in that direction.’ \\n\\nThe Arishtanemi looted at Shiva and nodded. They were batde-hardened men. They liked \\nnothing more than a clearheaded and calm leader who knew exactiy what he was doing. They \\nquickly got into the formation ordered by Shiva and waited. \\n\\nThen the real attackbegan. Forty Chandravanshi soldiers led by a hooded figure emerged from \\nthe trees, walking slowly towards the Suryavanshi caravan. The outnumbered \\n\\nArishtanemi remained stationary, waiting for their enemy to come to them. \\n\\n‘Surrender the princess to us and we will leave,’ said the hooded figure. ‘We want no \\nunnecessary bloodshed.’ \\n\\nThe same joker from the Brahma temple? He ‘s got a strange costume, but he fights well. \\n\\n‘We don’t want any bloodshed either,’said Shiva. ‘Leave quietly and we promise not to kill \\nyou.’ \\n\\n‘You’re the one who’s looking at death in the face, barbarian,’ said the hooded figure, \\nconveying anger through his posture rather than his voice, which remained eerily composed. \\n\\nShiva noticed the brown-turbaned officer look impatiently at the hooded figure. He clearly \\nwanted to attack fast and get this over with. \\n\\nDissension in the ranks? \\n\\n‘The only face I’m looking at is a stupid festival mask And it’s soon going to be shoved down \\nyour pathetic little throat! Also tell that brainless lieutenant of yours that he shouldn’t give battle \\nplans away.’ \\n\\nThe hooded figure remained calm. Not turning to lookat Vishwadyumna. \\n\\nDamn! This man is good. \\n\\n‘This is the last warning, barbarian,’ repeated the hooded figure. ‘Hand her over right now’ \\n\\nSati suddenly turned towards the carriage as she realised something, shouting, ‘Mother! The \\nnew emergency conch shell close to the front grill. Blow it now! ’ \\n\\nA loud plea for help emitted from the carriage. Bhabravya and his men had been summoned. \\nThe hooded figure cursed as he realised his advantage had been taken away. He had very little \\ntime to complete his operation. The other Suryavanshis would be backsoon. ‘Charge!’ \\n\\nThe Arishtanemi stayed in position. \\n\\n‘Steady,’said Shiva. ‘Wait for them. All you have to do is buy time. Keep the princess safe. \\nOur friends will be backsoon.’ \\n\\nAs the Chandravanshis came closer, Sati suddenly broke through the cordon and attacked the \\nhooded figure. Sati’s surprise attack slowed the charge of the Chandravanshis. The Arishtanemi \\nhad no choice. They charged at the Chandravanshis like vicious tigers. \\n\\nShiva moved quickly to protect the right flank of Sati as an advancing Vishwadyumna got \\ndangerously close to her. Vishwadyumna swung his sword to force Shiva out of his way. \\nHowever, the speed of Shiva’s advance left Vishwadyumna unbalanced. Shiva easily parried the \\nblow and pushed Vishwadyumna backwith his shield. Nandi meanwhile moved rapidly to the left \\nof Sati to blockthe Chandravanshis trying to charge down that side. \\n\\nIn the meantime, Sati was attacking the hooded figure with fierce blows. The hooded figure, \\nhowever, seemed intent to defend himself and was not striking back He wanted her alive and \\n\\n\\n\\nunharmed. \\n\\nShiva cut Vishwadyumna savagely across the shoulder that had been exposed when he was \\npushed back Grimacing, Vishwadyumna brought his shield up to fend off another attack from \\nShiva. With the same movement, Vishwadyumna brought his sword arm up to thrust at Shiva’s \\ntorso. Shiva quickly pulled his shield in to protect himself. But not quickly enough. Vishwadyumna \\nwas able to slash Shiva’s chest. Stepping back and jumping to his right, Shiva brought his sword \\nswifdy down in a brutal jab. While Vishwadyumna prompdy brought his shield up to block the \\nattach Shiva’s unorthodox move unsettled him. He staggered back realising that Shiva was an \\nexcellent swordsman. It was going to be a hard and long duel. \\n\\nNandi had already brought down one Chandravanshi soldier who had broken a law of combat \\nof never attacking below the waist and cut Nandi’s thigh. Bleeding profusely, Nandi was \\nferociously battling another soldier who had attacked him from the left. The Chandravanshi \\nbrought his shield down hard on Nandi’s injured leg, making him stagger and fall. The \\nChandravanshi thought he had his man. Raising his sword high with both his hands, he was about to \\nbring it down to finish the j ob but he suddenly arched forward, as if a brutal force had pounded \\nhim from the back As he fell, Nandi saw a knife buried deep in the Chandravanshi’s back \\nLooking up, he saw Shiva’s left arm continue down in a smooth arc from the release of the \\ndagger. With his right hand, Shiva brought his sword up to block a vicious cut from \\nVishwadyumna. As Nandi stumbled back to his feet, Shiva reached behind to pull his shield in \\nfront again. \\n\\nThe hooded figure knew they were taking too long. The other Arishtanemi would be back soon. \\nHe tried to go behind Sati, to club her on the back of the head and knock her unconscious but she \\nwas too quick She moved swifdy to the left to face her enemy again. Taking a knife out of her \\nangvastram folds with her left hand, she slashed outwards to cut deep across the hooded figure’s \\nimmense stomach. The knife sliced through the robe but its effect was broken by the armour. \\n\\nAnd then with a resounding roar, Bhabravya and the other Arishtanemi rushed back to fight \\nalongside their mates. \\n\\nSeeing themselves vastly outnumbered, the hooded figure had no choice. He ordered his \\nsoldiers to retreat. Shiva stopped Bhabravya from chasing the Chandravanshis once again. \\n\\n‘Let them go, brave Bhabravya,’said Shiva. ‘We will have other chances to get them. Right \\nnow the primary objective is to protect the royal family’ \\n\\nBhabravya looted at Shiva with admiration for the way this foreigner fought, not the blue throat \\nof which he was unaware. He nodded politely. ‘It mates sense, foreigner.’ \\n\\nBhabravya quickly formed the Arishtanemi soldiers into a tight perimeter and pulled the \\nwounded within. Dead bodies were not touched. At least three Arishtanemi lost their lives while \\nnine Chandravanshi bodies lay in the clearing. The last one had taken his own life since he was too \\nwounded to escape. Better to meet one’s mater rather than fall alive in enemy hands and reveal \\nsecrets. Bhabravya ordered his soldiers to stay low and keep their shields in front for protection \\nagainst any arrows. And they waited so till the rescue party arrived. \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\n‘My God,’ cried an anxious Daksha as he hugged Sati tight. \\n\\nThe rescue party of five hundred soldiers had reached by the fourth hour of the second prahar. \\nDaksha, Brahaspati and Kanakhala had accompanied the caravan despite Parvateshwar’s \\nwarnings of the risks. Releasing Sati from his grip, Daksha whispered as a small tear escaped his \\neyes, ‘You are not injured, are you?’ \\n\\n‘I am alright father,’ said Sati self-consciously. ‘Just a few cuts. Nothing serious.’ \\n\\n‘She fought very bravely,’ said Veerini, as she beamed with pride. \\n\\n‘I think that is a mother’s bias,’ said Sati, as her serious expression was restored. Turning \\ntowards Shiva, she continued, ‘It was Shiva who saved the day, father. He figured out the real \\nplan of the Chandravanshis and rallied everyone at the crucial moment. It was because of him \\nthat we beat them back’ \\n\\n‘Oh, I think she’s too generous,’ said Shiva. \\n\\nShe’s impressed. Finally!! \\n\\n‘She isn’t being generous at all, my Lord,’ said a visibly grateful Daksha. ‘You have started \\nyour magic already. We have actually beaten back a terrorist attack You don’t know how \\nsignificant this is for us! ’ \\n\\n‘But it wasn’t a terrorist attack, your Highness’ said Shiva. ‘It was an attempt to kidnap the \\nprincess.’ \\n\\n‘Kidnap?’ asked Daksha. \\n\\n‘That hooded man certainly wanted her alive and unharmed.’ \\n\\n‘What hooded man?! ’ cried Daksha, alarmed. \\n\\n‘That was the Naga, your Highness,’said Shiva, surprised at Daksha’s hysterical response. ‘I \\nhave seen that man fight. He is an excellent warrior. A little slow in his movements, but excellent \\nall the same. But while fighting Sati he was try ing his best not to hurt her.’ \\n\\nThe colour drained completely from Daksha’s face. Veerini glared at her husband with a \\nstrange mixture of fear and anger. The expressions on their faces made Shiva feel \\nuncomfortable, as if he was intruding on a private family moment. \\n\\n‘Father?’ asked a worried Sati. ‘Are you alright?’ \\n\\nHearing no response from Daksha, Shiva turned to Sati and said, ‘Perhaps it’s best if you speak \\nto your family alone. If you don’t mind, I will go check if Nandi and the other soldiers are \\nalright.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParvateshwar was walking around his men, checking on the injured and ensuring that they \\nreceived medical help, with Bhabravya two steps behind. He came up to the Chandravanshi who \\nhad been killed by Shiva while protecting Nandi. He roared in horror, This man has been stabbed \\nin the back! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Bhabravya with his head bowed. \\n\\n‘Who did this? Who broke the sacred rules of combat?’ \\n\\n‘I think it was the foreigner, my Lord. But I heard that he was trying to protect Captain Nandi \\nwho had been attacked by this Chandravanshi. And the Chandravanshi himself was not following \\nthe combat rules having attacked Nandi below the waist.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar turned with a withering look at Bhabravya, causing him to cower in fear. ‘Rules \\nare rules,’ he growled. ‘They are meant to be followed even if your enemy ignores them.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘Go mate sure that the dead get proper cremations. Including the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘My Lord?’ asked a surprised Bhabravya. ‘But they are terrorists.’ \\n\\n‘They may be terrorists,’ snarled Parvateshwar. ‘But we are Suryavanshis. We are the \\nfollowers of Lord Ram. There are norms that we follow even towards our enemies. The \\nChandravanshis will get proper cremations. Is that clear?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\n\\n— aom - \\n\\n‘Why do you call the foreigner “Your Lord”?’ asked an injured Arishtanemi lying next to \\nNandi. \\n\\nShiva had just departed after spending half an hour with Nandi and the other injured soldiers. If \\none saw the inj ured at this point, it would be impossible to believe that they had fought a battle j ust \\na few hours ago. They were talking jovially with each other. Some were ribbing their mates \\nabout how they had fallen for the red-herring at the beginning of the battle. In the Kshatriya way, \\nto laugh in the face of death was the ultimate mark of a man. \\n\\n‘Because he is my Lord,’ answered Nandi simply. \\n\\n‘But he is a foreigner. A caste unmarked foreigner,’ said the Arishtanemi. ‘He is a brave \\nwarrior, no doubt. But there are so many brave warriors in Meluha. What mates him so special? \\nAnd why does he spend so much time with the royal family?’ \\n\\n‘I can’t answer that, my friend. You will get to find out when the time is right.’ \\n\\nThe Arishtanemi looted at Nandi quizzically. Then shook his head and smiled. He was a soldier. \\nHe bothered himself only with the here and now. Bigger questions did not dwell too long in his \\nmind. ‘In any case, I think the time is right to tell you that you are a brave man, my friend. I saw \\nyou fight despite your injury. You don’t know the meaning of the word surrender. I would be \\nproud to have you as my bhraata!\\' \\n\\nThat was a big statement from the Arishtanemi. The bhraata system that was followed in the \\n\\n\\n\\nMeluhan army meant that each soldier up to the rank of a captain was assigned a mate of equal \\nrank The two bhraatas would be like brothers who would always fight together and lookout for \\neach other. They would willingly fight the world for each other, would never love the same \\nwoman and would always tell each other the truth, no matter how bitter. \\n\\nThe Arishtanemi were elite soldiers of the empire. An Arishtanemi offered to be a bhraata \\nonly to his own kind. Nandi knew that he could never really be the Arishtanemi’s bhraata. He had \\nto stay with the Lord. But the honour of being offered the brotherhood of an Arishtanemi was \\nenough to bring tears to Nandi’s eyes. \\n\\n‘Don’t get teary on me now,’ chorded the Arishtanemi, wrinkling his nose in amusement. \\n\\nNandi burst out in laughter as he slapped the Arishtanemi on his arm. \\n\\n‘What is your name, my friend?’ asked Nandi. \\n\\n‘Kaustav,’replied the Arishtanemi. ‘Someday we shall batde the main Chandravanshi army \\ntogether, my friend. And by the grace of Lord Ram, we will kill all those bastards! ’ \\n\\n‘By Lord Agni, we will! ’ \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘It was interesting how you got into the Naga’s mind,’said Brahaspati as he watched Shiva \\ngetting the gash on his torso cleaned and dressed. \\n\\nShiva had insisted that his injuries receive medical attention only after every other soldier’s \\nwounds had been tended. \\n\\n‘Well, I can’t really explain it,’ said Shiva. ‘How the Naga would thinkj ust seemed so obvious to \\nme.’ \\n\\n‘Well, I can explain it!’ \\n\\n‘Really? What?’ \\n\\n‘The explanation is that you are the omnipotent “N”, whose name cannot be spoken!’said \\nBrahaspati, opening his eyes wide and conjuring his hands up like an ancient magician. \\n\\nThey burst out laughing, causing Shiva to rock back slightly. The military doctor gave Shiva a \\nstern look, at which he immediately quietened down and let him finish tending to the wound. \\nHaving applied the Ayurvedic paste and covering it with the medicinal neem leaf, the doctor \\nbandaged the wound with a cotton cloth. \\n\\n‘You will need to change that every second day, foreigner,’ said the doctor pointing at the \\nbandage. ‘The royal doctor in Devagiri will be able to do it for you. And don’t let this area get wet \\nfor a week Also, avoid the Somras for this period since you will not be able to take a complete \\nbath.’ \\n\\n‘Oh he doesn’t need the Somras,’joked Brahaspati. ‘It’s already done all the damage it can on \\nhim.’ \\n\\nShiva and Brahaspati collapsed into helpless laughter again as the doctor waited away, shaking \\nhis head in exasperation. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘But seriously,’said Brahaspati calming down. ‘Why would they attack you? You have not \\nharmed anybody’ \\n\\n‘I don’t think the attack was on me. I think it was for Sati.’ \\n\\n‘Sati! Why Sati? That’s even more bizarre.’ \\n\\n‘It probably wasn’t specifically for Sati,’said Shiva. ‘I think the target was the royal family. \\nThe primary target was probably the Emperor. Since he wasn’t there, they went for the \\nsecondary target, Sati. I think the aim was to kidnap a royal and use that person as leverage.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati did not respond. He seemed worried. Clasping his hands together and bringing them \\nclose to his face, he looted into the distance, deep in thought. Shiva reached into his pouch and \\npulled out his chillum, before carefully filling it with some dried marijuana. Brahaspati turned to \\nlook at his friend, unhappy at what he was doing. \\n\\n‘I’ve never told you this before Shiva and I probably shouldn’t as, well... since you are a free \\nman,’said Brahaspati. ‘But I consider you my friend. And it is my duty to tell you the truth. I \\nhave seen some Egyptian merchants in Karachapa with this marijuana habit. It’s not good for \\nyou.’ \\n\\n‘You’re wrong, my friend,’said Shiva, grinning broadly. ‘This is actually the best habit in the \\nworld.’ \\n\\n‘You probably don’t know, Shiva. This has many harmful side effects. And worst of all, it even \\nharms your memory, causing untold damage to your ability to draw on past knowledge.’ \\n\\nShiva’s face suddenly became uncharacteristically serious. He gazed back at Brahaspati with a \\nmelancholic smile. ‘That is exactly why it is good, my friend. No idiot who smokes this is scared \\nof forgetting’ \\n\\nShiva lit up his chillum, tooka deep drag and continued, ‘They are scared of wot forgetting.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati stared sharply at Shiva, wondering what terrible past could have prompted his friend \\nto get addicted to the weed. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11 \\n\\n\\nNeelkanth Unveiled \\n\\n\\nThe next morning the royal caravan resumed its journey to Devagiri after spending the night at a \\ntemporary camp in the clearing. It wasn’t safe to travel at night considering the circumstances. \\nThe wounded, including Nandi, were lying in the first three carriages and the fifth one. The royal \\nfamily and Shiva travelled in the fourth. All the soldiers who had fought in the previous day’s \\nbatde were given the privilege of riding on horses in relative comfort. Brahaspati and Kanakhala \\nwalked along with the rest of the troops, in mourning for the three slain Arishtanemi. \\nParvateshwar, Bhabravya and two other soldiers bore a make-shift wooden palanquin that carried \\nthree urns containing the ashes of the martyrs. The urns would be given to their families for a \\nceremonial submersion in the Saraswati. Shiva, Sati and Nandi too wanted to walk but the doctor \\ninsisted they were in no condition to do so. \\n\\nParvateshwar waited with pride at the bravery of his soldiers. His boys, as he called them, had \\nshown they were made of a metal forged in Lord Indra’s own furnace. He cursed himself for not \\nbeing there to fight with them. He castigated himself for not being there to protect his \\ngoddaughter, bis Sati, when she was in danger. He prayed for the day when he would finally get \\na chance to destroy the cowardly Chandravanshis. He also silendy pledged that he would \\nanonymously donate his salary for the next six months to the families of the slain soldiers. \\n\\n‘Even I didn’t thinkhe would fall to these levels! ’ exclaimed Daksha in disgust. \\n\\nShiva and Sati, comfortably asleep in the carriage, were woken up by Daksha’s outburst. \\nVeerini looted up from the book that she was reading, narrowing her eyes to concentrate on her \\nhusband. \\n\\n‘Who, your Highness?’ asked Shiva groggjly. \\n\\n‘Dilipa! That blight on humanity! ’ said Daksha, barely concealing his loathing. \\n\\nVeerini continued to stare hard at her husband. She slowly reached out, pulled Sati’s hand in \\nhers, brought it close to her lips and kissed it gentiy. Then she put her other hand protectively on \\ntop of Sati’s hand. Sati looted at her mother warmly with a hint of a smile and rested her tired \\nhead on Veerini’s shoulders. \\n\\n‘Who is Dilipa, your Highness?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘He is the Emperor of Swadweep,’answered Daksha. ‘Everyone knows Sati is the apple of my \\neye. And they were possibly trying to kidnap her to force my hand!’ \\n\\nShiva gazed at Daksha with sympathy. He could understand the outrage of the Emperor at the \\nlatest Chandravanshi treachery. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘And to be reduced to the level of even using a Naga for this nefarious plan,’ said a furious \\nDaksha. ‘This just shows what the Chandravanshis are capable of!’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know if the Naga was being used, your Highness,’said Shiva softiy. ‘It appeared as \\nthough he was the leader.’ \\n\\nDaksha however was too lost in his righteous anger to even explore Shiva’s insinuation. ‘The \\nNaga may have been the leader of this particular platoon, my Lord, but he would almost \\ncertainly be under the overall command of the Chandravanshis. No Naga can be a leader. They \\nare cursed people born with horrific deformities and diseases in this birth as a punishment for \\nterrible crimes that they have committed in their previous birth. The Nagas are embarrassed to \\neven show their face to anyone. But they have tremendous power and skills. Their presence \\nstrifes terror in the heart of all Meluhans, and most Swadweepans as well. The Chandravanshis \\nhave sunk low enough to even consort with those deformed demons. They hate us so much that \\nthey don’t even realise the sins they are bringing on their own souls by interacting with the \\nNagas.’ \\n\\nShiva, Sati and Veerini continued to hear Daksha’s ranting in silence. \\n\\nTurning towards Shiva, Daksha continued, ‘Do you see the kind of vermin we are up against, \\nmy Lord? They have no code, no honour. And they outnumber us ten to one. We need your help \\nmy Lord. It’s not just my people, but my family as well. We are in danger.’ \\n\\n‘Your Highness, I will do all that I can to help you,’said Shiva. ‘But I am not a general. I cannot \\nlead an army against the Chandravanshis. I am just a simple tribal leader. What difference can \\none man male?’ \\n\\n‘At least let me announce your presence to the court and the people, my Lord,’urged Daksha. \\n‘Just spend a few weeks travelling through the empire. Your presence will raise the morale of the \\npeople. Lookat the difference you made yesterday. We actually foiled a terrorist attack because \\nof you, because of your presence of mind. Please, let me announce your arrival. That is all I \\nask’ \\n\\nShiva looked at Daksha’s earnest face with trepidation. He could feel Sati’s and Veerini’s eyes \\non him. Especially Sati’s. \\n\\nWhat am I getting myself into? \\n\\n‘All right,’ said Shiva in resignation. \\n\\nDaksha got up and hugged Shiva in an unyielding grip. \\n\\n‘Thankyou, my Lord!’exclaimed Daksha, as Shiva withdrew from his embrace to come up \\nfor air. ‘I will announce your presence at the court tomorrow itself. Then you can leave for a tour \\nof the empire in another three weeks. I will personally make all the arrangements. You will have \\na full brigade travelling with you for security. Parvateshwar and Sati will accompany you as \\nwell.’ \\n\\n‘No!’protested Veerini in a harsh tone that Sati had never heard her mother use. ‘Sati is not \\ngoing anywhere. I am not going to allow you to put our daughter’s life in danger. She is staying \\nwith me in Devagiri.’ \\n\\n‘Veerini, don’t be silly,’said Daksha calmly. ‘You really think that anything would happen to \\nSati if the Lord Neelkanth was around. She is at the safest when she is with the Lord.’ \\n\\n‘She is not going. And that is final! ’ glared Veerini in a firm voice, clutching Sati’s hand tighdy. \\n\\nDaksha turned towards Shiva, ignoring Veerini. ‘Don’t worry, my Lord. I will have all the \\n\\n\\n\\narrangements made. Parvateshwar and Sati will also travel with you. You will just have to \\nrestrain Sati sometimes.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. So did Sati. \\n\\nDaksha smiled genially. ‘My darling daughter has the tendency to be a litde too brave at times, \\nlike this one time, when she was just a child, she had jumped in all by herself, with nothing but her \\nshort sword, to save an old woman being attacked by a pack of wild dogs. She nearly got herself \\nkilled for her pains. It was one of the worst days of my life. I think it is the same impulsiveness \\nwhich worries Veerini as well.’ \\n\\nShiva looked at Sati. There was no expression on her face. \\n\\n‘That’s why,’ continued Daksha, ‘I am suggesting that you keep her restrained. Then there \\nshould be no problem.’ \\n\\nShiva glanced again at Sati. He felt a surge of admiration coupled with the boundless love he \\nfelt for her. \\n\\nShe did what I couldn’t do. \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\nThe next morning, Shiva found himself seated next to Daksha in the Meluhan royal court. The \\nmagnificence of the court left him wonderstruck Since this was a public building, the usual \\nMeluhan reticence and understated designs had been bypassed. It was built next to the Great \\nPublic Bath. While the platform had been constructed of the standard kiln-bricks, the structure \\nitself, including the floor, was made of teak wood — easily carved and shaped, yet strong. \\nBrawny wooden pillars had been laid into set grooves on the platform. The pillars had been \\nextravagantly sculpted with celestial figures like apsaras, devas and rishis —celestial nymphs, \\ngods and sages — amongst others. An ornately carved wooden roof that had been inlaid with gold \\nand silver designs crowned the top of the pillars. Pennants of the holy blue colour and royal red \\ncolour hung from the ceiling. Each niche on the walls had paintings depicting the life of Lord \\nRam. But Shiva had little time to admire the glorious architecture of the court. \\n\\nDaksha’s expectations would be apparent in his speech and were causing him considerable \\ndiscomfort. \\n\\n‘As many of you may have heard,’announced Daksha, ‘there was another terrorist attack \\nyesterday. The Chandravanshis tried to harm the royal family on the road from Mount Mandar \\nto Devagiri.’ \\n\\nMurmurs of dismay filled the court. The question troubling everyone was how the \\nChandravanshis had discovered the route to Mount Mandar. Shiva meanwhile kept reminding \\nhimself that this wasn’t a terrorist attack It was j ust a kidnap attempt. \\n\\n‘The Chandravanshis had planned their attack with great deception,’said Daksha, drowning out \\nthe murmurs with his booming voice. \\n\\nThe talented architects of the court had designed the structure in a manner that any voice \\n\\n\\n\\nspoken from the royal platform resonated across the entire hall. ‘But we beat them back For the \\nfirst time in decades, we beat backa cowardly terrorist attack’ \\n\\nAn exultant roar went up in the court at this announcement. They had beaten back open \\nmilitary assaults from the Chandravanshis before. But until this day, the Meluhans had found no \\nanswer to the dreaded terrorist strikes. For the terrorists usually launched surprise attacks on non¬ \\nmilitary locations and fled before the Suryavanshi soldiers could arrive. \\n\\nRaising his hand to quieten the crowd, Daksha continued, ‘We beat them back because the time \\nfor truth to triumph has finally arrived! We beat them back because we were led by Father \\nManu’s messenger! We beat them backbecause our time for justice has come!’ \\n\\nThe murmurs grew louder. Had the Neelkanth finally arrived? Everyone had heard the \\nrumours. But nobody believed them. There had been too many false declarations in the past. \\n\\nDaksha raised his hand. He waited for just enough time for the anticipation to build up. And \\nthen jubilantly bellowed, ‘Yes! The rumours are true. Our saviour has come! The Neelkanth has \\ncome!’ \\n\\nShiva winced at being put on display on the royal platform with his cravat removed. The \\nMeluhan elite thronged around him, their varying statements buzzing in Shiva’s ears. \\n\\n‘We had heard the rumours, my Lord. But we never believed them to be true.’ \\n\\n‘We have nothing to fear anymore, my Lord. The days of evil are numbered!’ \\n\\n‘Where are you from, my Lord?’ \\n\\n‘Mount Kailash? Where is that, my Lord? I would like to take a pilgrimage there.’ \\n\\nAnswering these repeated questions and being confronted by the blind faith of these people \\ndisturbed Shiva. The moment he had a chance, he requested Daksha for permission to leave the \\ncourt. \\n\\n\\n— aom - \\n\\nA few hours later, Shiva sat in the quiet comfort of his chamber, considering what had \\nhappened at the court. The cravat was back around his neck \\n\\n‘By the Holy Lake, can I really deliver these people from their troubles?’ \\n\\n‘What did you say, my Lord?’ asked Nandi, who was sitting patiently at a distance. \\n\\n‘The faith of your people mates me anxious,’said Shiva, loud enough for Nandi to hear. ‘If \\nthere was a one-on-one battie, I could take on any enemy to protect your people. But I am no \\nleader. And I am certainly not a “destroyer of evil”.’ \\n\\n‘I am sure that you can lead us to victory against anyone, my Lord. You beat them backon the \\nroad to Devagiri.’ \\n\\n‘That wasn’t a genuine victory,’said Shiva dismissively. ‘They were a small platoon, aiming to \\nkidnap and not to kill. If we face a well organised and large army, whose aim is to kill, the \\nsituation may be very different. If you askme, it appears that Meluha is against some formidable \\nand ruthless enemies. Your country doesn’t need faith in just one man. That is not the answer. \\n\\n\\n\\nYour people need to adapt to the changing times. Maybe you are too innocent in your way of life \\nto actually take on such a cold-blooded enemy. A new system is needed. I am not some god who \\nwill magically solve your problems.’ \\n\\n‘You are right, my Lord,’ said Nandi, with all the conviction of a simple, lucky man not \\ntroubled by too many thoughts. ‘A new system is required, and I obviously don’t know what this \\nnew system should be. But I do understand one thing. More than a thousand years back, we faced \\na similar situation and Lord Ram came and taught us a better way. I am sure that, similarly, you \\nwill lead us to a superior path.’ \\n\\n‘I am no Lord Ram, Nandi! ’ \\n\\nHow can this fool even compare me to Lord Ram, the Maryada Purushottam, the Ideal Man? \\n\\n‘You are better than Lord Ram, my Lord,’ said Nandi. \\n\\n‘Stop this nonsense, Nandi! What have I done to even be compared with Lord Ram? Let alone \\nbe considered better?’ \\n\\n‘But you will do deeds that will place you above him, my Lord.’ ‘Just shut up! ’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\nThe preparations for Shiva’s tour of the empire were in full swing. Shiva, however, still found \\ntime for Sati’s dance lessons every afternoon. They were developing a quiet friendship. But Shiva \\nagonised over the fact that while she showed respect, there was no softening of emotions in her or \\nexpression of feelings. \\n\\nIn the meantime, Shiva’s tribe had been summoned to Devagiri, where they were given \\ncomfortable accommodation and jobs. Bhadra, however, was not to stay with the Gunas. He had \\ninstead been assigned to accompany the Neelkanth on his voyage. \\n\\n‘Peerbhadra! When the hell did you get this name?’Shiva asked Bhadra, meeting him for the \\nfirst time since his departure from Kashmir. \\n\\n‘Stupid reason actually,’smiled Bhadra, whose slight hump had disappeared completely, thanks \\nto the magical Somras. ‘On the journey here, I saved the caravan leader from a tiger attack. He \\ngave me the tide for a brave man before my name.’ \\n\\n‘You fought a tiger single-handed?’ asked Shiva, clearly impressed. \\n\\nBhadra nodded feeling awkward. \\n\\n‘Well, then you really deserve to be called Veerbhadra!’ \\n\\n‘Yeah right!’smiled Bhadra, suddenly turning serious. ‘The crazy label of “destroyer of evil”... \\nAre you okay with this? You are not giving in to these pleas j ust because of your past, are you?’ \\n\\n‘I am going with the flow right now, my friend. Something tells me that despite all my \\nmisgivings, I can actually help these people. These Meluhans are completely mad, no doubt. And \\nI certainly can’t do ALL that they expect of me. But I do feel that if I can mate a difference, \\nhowever small, I can reconcile with my past.’ \\n\\n‘If you are sure, then so am 1.1 will follow you anywhere.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Don’t follow. Walk beside me! ’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra laughed and embraced his friend. ‘I missed you Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘I missed you too.’ \\n\\n‘Let’s meet in the garden in the afternoon. I’ve got a great batch of marijuana.’ \\n\\n‘It’s a deal!’ \\n\\nBrahaspati too had sought permission to travel with Shiva. He explained that a Mesopotamian \\nship carrying some rare chemicals, essential for a critical experiment, was to dockat the port city \\nof Karachapa soon. His team had to checkand obtain those materials anyway. It would be a good \\nidea to do this while travelling with Shiva. Daksha said that he had no problems with Brahaspati \\njoining the tour if the Lord was okay with it. Shiva agreed enthusiastically to the suggestion. \\n\\nThree weeks after the court announcement about the Neelkanth, the day finally dawned for \\nShiva’s tour of the empire. On the morning of the day itself, Daksha walked into Shiva’s \\nchambers. \\n\\n‘You could have summoned me, your Highness,’said Shiva with a namaste. ‘You did not need \\nto come here.’ \\n\\n‘It is my pleasure to come to your chambers, my Lord,’smiled Daksha, returning Shiva’s \\ngreeting with a low bow. ‘I thought I would introduce the physician who would be travelling with \\nyour entourage. She arrived from Kashmir last night.’ \\n\\nDaksha moved aside to let his escort show the doctor into the room. \\n\\n‘Ayurvati! ’ exclaimed Shiva, his face lit up in a brilliant smile. ‘It’s so good to see you again! ’ \\n\\n‘The pleasure is all mine, my Lord,’ beamed Ayurvati, as she bent down to touch Shiva’s feet. \\n\\nShiva immediately moved back to neatly side-step Ayurvati. ‘I have told you before, \\nAyurvati,’ said Shiva. ‘You are a giver of life. Please don’t embarrass me by touching my feet.’ \\n\\n‘And you are the Neelkanth, my Lord. The destroyer of evil,’said Ayurvati with devotion. \\n‘How can you deny me the privilege of being blessed by you?’ \\n\\nShiva shook his head in despair and let Ayurvati touch his feet. He gently touched her head and \\nblessed her. \\n\\nA few hours later, Shiva, Sati, Parvateshwar, Brahaspati, Ayurvati, Krittika, Nandi and \\nVeerbhadra set off. Accompanying them was a brigade of fifteen hundred soldiers, twenty-five \\nhandmaidens and fifty support staff for their security and comfort. They planned to travel by \\nroad till the city of Kotdwaar on the Beas river. From there, they would use boats to travel to the \\nport city of Karachapa. Then they would move due east to the city of Lothal. Finally, they would \\nmove north by road to the inland delta of the Saraswati and then by boats back to Devagiri. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12 \\n\\n\\nJourney through Meluha \\n\\n‘Who was Manu?’ asked Shiva. ‘I have heard of him often, referred to as “the Father”.’ \\n\\nThe caravan had been travelling for a few days on the broad road from Devagiri to Kotdwaar. \\nThe central part consisted of a row of seven carriages identical to the ones used during the trip to \\nMandar. Five of them were empty. Shiva, Sati, Brahaspati and Krittika travelled in the second \\ncarriage. Parvateshwar was in the fifth, along with Ayurvati and his key brigadiers. The general’s \\npresence meant every rule had to be adhered to strictly. Hence Nandi, whose rank did not allow \\nhim to travel in the carriage, was riding a horse with the rest of the cavalry. Veerbhadra had been \\ninducted as a soldier in Nandi’s platoon. Led by their respective captains, the brigade were in \\nstandard forward, rear and side defence formations around the caravan. \\n\\nBoth Brahaspati and Sati started answering Shiva simultaneously. \\n\\n‘Lord Manu was the...’ \\n\\nThey both stopped talking. \\n\\n‘After you please, Brahaspatiji,’ said Sati. \\n\\n“No, no,’ said Brahaspati with a warm smile. ‘Why don’t you tell him the story?’ \\n\\nHe knew whose voice the Neelkanth would prefer. \\n\\n‘Of course not, Brahaspatij i. How can I supersede you? It would be completely improper.’ \\n\\n‘Will somebody answer me or are you two going to keep up this elaborate protocol forever?’ \\nasked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Alright, alright,’ laughed Brahaspati. ‘Don’t turn blue all over now.’ \\n\\n‘That is hilarious Brahaspati,’smiled Shiva. ‘Keep this up and you might actually get someone \\nto laugh in a hundred years.’ \\n\\nAs Brahaspati and Shiva chortled, Sati was astounded at the inappropriate manner in which the \\nconversation was going on. But if the revered chief scientist seemed comfortable, she would not \\nsay anything. And in any case, how could she reprimand Shiva? Her code of honour forbade it. \\nHe had saved her life. Twice. \\n\\n‘Well, you are right about Lord Manu being the Father,’said Brahaspati. ‘He is considered the \\nprogenitor of our civilisation by all the people of India.’ \\n\\n‘Including Swadweepans?’ asked Shiva incredulously. \\n\\n‘Yes, we believe so. In any case, Lord Manu lived more than eight and a half thousand years \\nbefore the present day. He was apparently a prince from south India. A land way beyond the \\nNarmada river, where the earth ends and the great ocean begins. That land is the Sangamtamil.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Sangamtamil?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. Sangamtamil was then the richest and most powerful country in the world. Lord Manu’s \\nfamily, the Pandyas, had ruled that land for many generations. However, from the records left \\nby Lord Manu, we know that by his time the kings had lost their old code of honour. Having fallen \\non corrupt ways, they spent their days in the pleasures of their fabulous wealth rather than being \\nfocused on their duties and their spiritual life. Then a terrible calamity occurred. The seas rose \\nand destroyed their entire civilisation.’ \\n\\n‘My God!’exclaimed Shiva. \\n\\n‘Lord Manu knew that this day would come and had in fact prepared for it. He believed it was \\nthe decadence his old country had fallen into that had incurred the wrath of the gods. Wanting to \\nescape the calamity, he led a band of his followers to the northern, higher lands in a fleet of ships. \\nHe established his first camp at a place called Mehragarh deep in the western mountains of \\npresent day Meluha. Wanting to establish a moral and just society, he gave up his princely robes \\nand became a priest. In fact the term for priests in India, pandit, is a derivation of Lord Manu’s \\nfamily name — Pandya.’ \\n\\n‘Interesting. So how did Lord Manu’s litde band grow into the formidable India we see today?’ \\n\\n‘The years immediately following their arrival at Mehragarh were harsh on them. With each \\nyear’s monsoon, the flooding and sea tides would become stronger. But after many years and \\nwith the force of Lord Manu’s prayers, the anger of the gods abated and the waters stopped \\nadvancing. The sea, however, never receded to its original levels.’ \\n\\n‘This means that somewhere in the deep south, the sea still covers the ancient Sangamtamil \\ncities?’ \\n\\n‘We believe so,’ answered Brahaspati. ‘Once the sea stopped advancing, Lord Manu and his \\nmen came down the mountains. They were shocked to see that the minor stream of Indus had \\nbecome a massive river. Many other rivulets across northern India too had swollen and six great \\nrivers had emerged — Indus, Saraswati, Yamuna, Ganga, Sarayu and Brahmaputra. Lord Manu \\nsaid the rivers started flowing because the temperatures of our land rose with the wrath of the \\ngods. With the rise in temperatures, huge channels of ice or glaciers frozen high in the Himalayas \\nhad started melting, creating the rivers.’ \\n\\n‘Hmm...’ \\n\\n‘Villages, and later cities, grew on the banks of these rivers. Thus our land of the seven rivers, \\nSapt-Sindhu, was born out of the destruction of the Sangamtamil.’ \\n\\n‘Seven? But you mentioned the creation of six rivers in North India.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, that’s true. The seventh river already existed. It is the Narmada and it became our \\nsouthern border. Lord Manu strictly forbade his descendants to go south of the Narmada. And if \\nthey did so, they could never return. This is a law that we believe even the Chandravanshis \\nadhere to.’ \\n\\n‘So what are Lord Manu’s other laws?’ \\n\\n‘There are numerous laws actually. They are all listed in an extensive treatise called the \\nManusmriti. Would you be interested in listening to the entire text?’ \\n\\n‘Tempting,’ smiled Shiva. ‘But I think I’ll pass.’ \\n\\n‘With your permission, my Lords, perhaps we can further discuss Lord Manu’s guidance of our \\nsociety over lunch,’ suggested Krittika. \\n\\n\\n\\n— *@m — \\n\\nAt a short distance from the road on which the Neelkanth’s caravan travelled, a small band of \\nabout forty men trudged silently along the Beas. One in two men of the platoon carried a small \\ncoracle on his head. It was typical of this region. The locals made small and light boats made of \\nbamboo, cane and rope, portable enough to be carried by a single man on his head. Each boat \\ncould ferry two people with relative safety and speed. At the head of the platoon was a young \\nman with a proud battle scar adorning his face, his head crowned with a brown turban. A little \\nahead of him walked a hooded figure. With his head bowed, his eyes scrunched, he took slow \\nmethodical steps, his mind lost in unfathomable thoughts. His breathing was hard. He brought his \\nhand up languidly to rub his masted forehead. There was a leather bracelet on his right wrist with \\nthe serpent Aum symbol embroidered on it. \\n\\n‘Vishwadyumna,’ said the hooded figure. ‘We will enter the river from here. Whenever we \\ncome close to populated areas, we will move away from the river to avoid detection. We have to \\nreach Karachapa within two months.’ \\n\\n‘Karachapa, my Lord?’asked Vishwadyumna surprised. ‘I was under the impression that we \\nwere to have a secret audience with the Queen outside Lothal.’ \\n\\n‘No,’ answered the hooded figure. We will meet her outside Karachapa.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’answered Vishwadyumna, as he looted back in the direction of the road to \\nKotdwaar. He knew that his Lord would have dearly liked to mate one more attempt to kidnap the \\nprincess. He also knew that it was foolhardy to endeavour to do so considering the strength of the \\nforce accompanying the caravan. In any case, they were behind schedule for their main \\nmission. They had to meet the Queen urgently. \\n\\nTurning towards one of his soldiers, Vishwadyumna ordered, ‘Sriktaa, place your coracle in the \\nriver and give me y our oar. I will row the Lord through this part of the j ourney ’ \\n\\nSriktaa immediately did as instructed. Vishwadyumna and the hooded figure were the first of \\nthe platoon to enter the river. Vishwadyumna had already started rowing as his men started \\nplacing their boats into the waters. At a distance further down the river, the hooded figure saw two \\nwomen lounging carelessly on a boat. One of the women was sloppily splashing water from the \\nside of the boat on to her friend who was making a hopeless attempt to avoid getting wet. Their \\nchildish game caused their boat to sway dangerously from side to side. The hooded figure saw \\nthat the women had not detected a crocodile that had entered the river from the opposite bank \\nHaving spied what must have looted like an appetising meal, the crocodile was swimming swiftly \\ntowards the women’s boat. \\n\\n‘Lookbehind you!’shouted the hooded figure to the women, as he motioned to Vishwadyumna \\nto row rapidly in their direction. \\n\\nThe women could not hear him from the distance. What they did see, however, was two men \\nwere rowing towards them. They could see one of them was almost a giant covered from head to \\ntoe in a strange robe, his face covered with a mask This man was making frantic gestures. Behind \\n\\n\\n\\nthe duo were a large number of soldiers swiftly pushing their boats on to the river. That was all \\nthe warning the women needed. Thinking that the men were coming towards them with evil \\nintent, the women put all their effort behind the oar and started hastily rowing away from the \\nhooded figure’s boat. Into the path of the crocodile. \\n\\n‘No! ’ shouted the hooded figure. \\n\\nHe grabbed the oar from Vishwadyumna, using his powerful arms to row rapidly. He was \\nshortening the distance between them and the women. But not fast enough. The crocodile closed \\nin on the women’s boat and diving underwater charged at the craft, rocking it with its massive \\nbody. The tiny vessel tilted and capsized, throwing the women into the Beas. \\n\\nScreams of terror rent the air as the women fought to stay afloat. The crocodile had moved too \\nfar ahead in its dash. Turning around, it swam towards the struggling women. The delay of those \\ncrucial seconds proved fateful for the women. The rescue boat arrived between the crocodile and \\nthem. Turning towards Vishwadyumna, the hooded figure ordered, ‘Save the women.’ \\n\\nBefore Vishwadyumna could react, he had flung his robe aside and dived into the river. With \\nhis knife held tight between his teeth, he swam towards the advancing crocodile. Vishwadyumna \\npulled one of the women into the boat. She had already lost consciousness. Turning to the other \\nwoman, he reassured, ‘I am coming back soon.’ \\n\\nVishwadyumna turned and paddled vigorously towards the bank. On the way he passed some \\nof his other soldiers. ‘Row quickly. The Lord’s life is in danger.’ \\n\\nThe other soldiers paddled towards the area where the hooded figure had dived into the river. \\nThe water had turned red with blood from the battle raging under water. The soldiers said a silent \\nprayer to Lord Vanin, the god of the water and the seas, hoping that the blood did not belong to \\ntheir Lord. \\n\\nOne of the soldiers was about to jump into the water with his sword when the hooded figure \\nemerged onto the surface, soaked in blood. It was that of the crocodile. He swam forcefully \\ntowards the other woman who was on the verge of losing consciousness. Reaching her in the nick \\nof time, he pulled her head out of the water. Meanwhile, two of the Chandravanshi soldiers dived \\noff their coracle. \\n\\n‘My Lord, please get into the boat,’ said one of them. ‘We will swim ashore.’ \\n\\n‘Help the woman first,’ replied the hooded figure. \\n\\nThe soldiers pulled the unconscious woman on to the coracle. The hooded figure then carefully \\nclimbed aboard and rowed towards the shore. By the time the hooded figure reached the river \\nbank, the other woman had been revived by Vishwadyumna. She sat disoriented at the rapid \\nchain of events. \\n\\n‘Are you alright?’ Vishwadyumna asked the woman. \\n\\nIn answer, the woman looked beyond Vishwadyumna and screamed. Vishwadyumna turned \\naround. On the river bank, the hooded figure was coming ashore carrying the other woman’s limp \\nbody. His clothes were glued to his massive body. To the disoriented woman, the crocodile’s \\nblood all over his clothes, seemed like that of her friend. \\n\\n‘What have you done, you beast?’ shrieked the woman. \\n\\nThe Naga looked up abruptly. His eyes showed mild surprise. He, however, refrained from \\nsaying anything. He gently laid the unconscious woman on the ground. As he did so, the mask on \\nhis face came undone. The woman next to Vishwadyumna stared at him with horror. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Naga!’she screeched. \\n\\nBefore Vishwadyumna could react, she leapt to her feet and fled screaming, ‘Help! Help! A \\nNaga is eating my friend! ’ \\n\\nThe Naga looked at the fleeing woman with melancholic eyes. He shut the windows to his \\ntormented soul and shook his head slightly. Vishwadyumna meanwhile turned to see his Lord’s \\nface for the first time in years. He immediately lowered his gaze, but not before he had seen the \\nrare emotion of intense pain and sorrow in his Lord’s normally expressionless eyes. Seething in \\nanger, Vishwadyumna drew his sword, swearing to slay the ungrateful wench he had just saved. \\n\\n‘No, Vishwadyumna,’ ordered the Naga. Pulling his mask back on, he turned to his other \\nsoldiers. ‘Revive her.’ \\n\\n‘My Lord,’argued Vishwadyumna. ‘Her friend will bring others here. Let’s leave this woman \\nto her fate and go.’ \\n\\n‘No.’ \\n\\n‘But my Lord, someone may come soon. We must escape.’ \\n\\n‘Not till we’ve saved her,’ said the Naga, in his usual calm voice. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nThe royal party, including Nandi and Veerbhadra, were sitting together enjoying their lunch in \\nthe courtyard of the rest-house they had stopped at. Half the brigade too was eating their meal. \\nThey needed all the energy they could gather to march in this scorching heat. Parvateshwar had \\ncome in to check on the food arrangements. He was especially concerned about Sati’s comfort. \\nHowever, he had refused to join them. He was going to eat later with his soldiers. \\n\\nA loud commotion from the area of one of the perimeter guards disturbed Shiva. He got up to \\ninvestigate, motioning to Brahaspati, Nandi and Veerbhadra to remain seated. Parvateshwar too \\nhad heard the racket and was moving towards the uproar. \\n\\n‘Please save her!’ cried the woman. ‘A Naga is eating her alive!’ \\n\\n‘I am sorry,’answered the captain. ‘But we have strict orders. We are not to leave the vicinity \\nof this rest-house under any circumstances.’ \\n\\n‘What is the matter?’ asked Parvateshwar. \\n\\nTurning in surprise, the captain saluted and bowed low. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’said the captain. ‘This woman alleges that a Naga has attacked her friend. She’s \\nasking us to help her.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted at the woman intensely. He would have liked nothing more than to chase \\nthe Naga party and destroy them. But his orders were crystal clear. He was not to leave the \\nNeelkanth and Sati. Their protection was the only objective of the brigade. But he was a \\nKshatriya. What kind of Kshatriya would he be if he didn’t fight to protect the weak? Seething at \\nthe restrictions forced upon him, Parvateshwar was about to say something when Shiva appeared. \\n\\n‘What’s the matter?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘My Lord,’said the captain in awe. He could not believe that he was actually getting a chance \\nto converse with the Neelkanth. This woman claims that her friend has been attacked by Nagas. \\nWe are concerned that it may be a trap. We have heard about the Chandravanshi duplicity on the \\nMount Mandar road.’ \\n\\nShiva heard his inner voice cry. ‘Go backl Help her! ’ \\n\\nDrawing his sword in one smooth motion he told the woman, ‘Take me to your friend.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted at Shiva with respect. It was mild, but it was respect all the same. He \\nimmediately drew his own sword and turned to the captain, ‘Follow us with your platoon. \\nBrigadier Vraka, put the entire brigade on alert for any surprise attack. The princess must be kept \\nsafe at all costs!’ \\n\\nShiva and Parvateshwar ran behind the woman who seemed to lead them with ease. She was \\nobviously a local. The captain trailed them with his platoon of thirty soldiers. After sprinting for \\nthe larger part of half an hour, they finally reached the riverside to find a dazed woman sitting on \\nthe ground. With heavy breaths, she was staring in shock at an imaginary vision in the distance. \\nThere was blood all over her clothes, but strangely, no injury to her. There were many footsteps \\nthat appeared to be coming out of the river and going back in. \\n\\nThe captain looted at the woman who had led them here with suspicious eyes. Turning to his \\nsoldiers, he ordered, ‘Form a perimeter around the General and the Neelkanth. It could be a trap.’ \\n\\n‘She was being eaten alive, I tell you,’screeched the woman, absolutely stunned to see her \\nfriend alive and unharmed. \\n\\n‘No she wasn’t,’ said Shiva calmly. He pointed at the corpse of the crocodile floating in the \\nriver. A large flock of crows had settled on the carcass, fighting viciously over its entrails. \\n‘Somebody just saved her from that crocodile.’ \\n\\n‘Whoever it was has rowed across the river, my Lord,’said the captain, pointing towards the \\nheavy footmarks close to the river. \\n\\n‘Why would a Naga riskhis own life to save this woman?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\nParvateshwar seemed as surprised. This was completely unlike the usual blood thirsty Nagas \\nthey had dealt with till now. \\n\\n‘My Lords,’ said the captain, addressing both Shiva and Parvateshwar. ‘The women appear \\nsafe. Perhaps it is not wise for everybody to stay here. If I have your permission, I will escort \\nthese women back to their village and rejoin the caravan at Kotdwaar. You could retire to the \\nrest-house.’ \\n\\n‘All right,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘Take four soldiers with you just in case.’ \\n\\nBoth Shiva and Parvateshwar waited back, baffled by this bizarre event. \\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nIt was late in the evening. Shiva, Brahaspati, Nandi and Veerbhadra sat quietly around the \\ncamp fire. Shiva turned to see Sad sitting at a distance, on the rest-house veranda, along with \\n\\n\\n\\nAyurvati and Krittika, having a serious conversation. Parvateshwar as usual, moved among his \\nsoldiers, personally supervising the security arrangements of the camp and the comfort of his \\nboys. \\n\\n‘It’s ready, Shiva,’ said Veerbhadra, handing over the chillum to the Neelkanth. \\n\\nShiva brought the pipe up to his lips and pulled hard. He relaxed visibly. Feeling the need for \\nrespite, he smoked some more before passing it back to his friend. Veerbhadra offered it to \\nBrahaspati and Nandi, who both declined. Brahaspati stared at Shiva who kept stealing glances at \\nSati. He smiled and shook his head. \\n\\n‘What?’ asked Shiva who had noticed Brahaspati’s gesture. \\n\\n‘I understand your longing, my friend,’whispered Brahaspati. ‘But what you are hoping for is \\nquite difficult. Almost impossible.’ \\n\\n‘When it’s so valuable, it can’t be easy. Can it?’ \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled and patted Shiva on his hand. \\n\\nVeerbhadra knew what his friend needed. Dance and music. It always improved his mood. \\n‘Don’t people sing and dance in this wretched country.’ \\n\\n‘Private Veerbhadra,’said Nandi, his tone different with a subordinate, ‘firstly, this country is \\nnot wretched. It’s the greatest land in the world.’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra playfully put his hands together in a mockapology. \\n\\n‘Secondly,’ continued Nandi, ‘we dance only when an occasion demands it, like the Holi \\nfestival or a public performance.’ \\n\\n‘But the greatest joy of dancing is when you do it for no reason at all, Captain,’ said \\nVeerbhadra. \\n\\n‘I agree,’ said Shiva. \\n\\nNandi immediately fell silent. \\n\\nWithout any warning, Veerbhadra suddenly burst out into one of the folksongs of his region. \\nShiva smiled at his friend, for Veerbhadra was singing one of his favourites. Continuing to sing, \\nVeerbhadra rose slowly and began dancing to the lilting tune, now accompanied by Shiva. The \\ncombination of marijuana and dance immediately changed his mood. \\n\\nBrahaspati stared at Shiva, first in shock and then with pleasure. He noticed a pattern in their \\ndancing, a smooth six-step combination repeated rhythmically. Shiva reached out and pulled \\nBrahaspati and Nandi to their feet. They joined in, tentative at first. But it was only a matter of \\ntime before a reluctant Brahaspati was dancing with abandon. The group moved together in a \\ncircle around the fire, the singing louder and livelier. \\n\\nShiva suddenly darted out of the ring towards Sati. ‘Dance with me.’ \\n\\nA flabbergasted Sati shook her head. \\n\\n‘Oh come on! If you can dance while your Guruji and I watch, why not here?’ \\n\\n‘That was for knowledge! ’ said Sati. \\n\\n‘So? Is it wrong if we’re not dancing for knowledge?’ \\n\\n‘I didn’t say that.’ \\n\\n‘Fine. Have it your way,’ said Shiva with a frustrated gesture. ‘Ayurvati, come!’ \\n\\nA starded Ayurvati didn’t know how to react. Before she could decide on a course of action, \\nShiva held her hand and pulled her into the circle. Veerbhadra lured Krittika in as well. The group \\ndanced boisterously and sang loudly, making a racket in an otherwise quiet night. Sati got up, \\n\\n\\n\\nclearly agitated, glared at Shiva’s back and ran into the rest-house. Shiva’s anger rose even higher \\nas he noticed her absence when he turned towards the veranda. \\n\\nDamn! \\n\\nHe got back to his dance, his heart in a strange mixture of pain and joy. He turned once again \\ntowards the veranda. There was nobody. \\n\\nWho’s behind that curtain? \\n\\nShiva was dragged into the next move by Veerbhadra. It was a few moments later that Shiva \\nwas in a position to look again at the veranda. He could see Sati, outlined behind the curtain, \\nstaring at him. Only at him. \\n\\nWow! \\n\\nA surprised and delighted Shiva swung back into his dance, moving in his prime form. He had \\nto impress her! \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13 \\n\\n\\nBlessings of the Impure \\n\\nKotdwaar was in all its glory to receive the Neelkanth. Torches had been lit across the fort \\nperimeter as if it was Diwali. Red and blue pennants, embellished with the Suryavanshi Sun, had \\nbeen hung down the fort walls. In a rare breach of protocol, the governor had come outside the \\ncity to personally receive the Neelkanth. After the formal exhibition of the Neelkanth for the \\nKotdwaar elite at the local court, a public function had been organised the following day. Sixty- \\nfive thousand people, practically the entire population of Kotdwaar, had converged for the event. \\nConsidering the vast number of attendees, the event had been organised outside the city platform \\nto ensure that every person could be accommodated. \\n\\nA speech by Shiva convinced the Kotdwaarans that Meluha’s days of trouble were soon to end. \\nThe remarkable effect Shiva seemed to have on the people was a revelation to him. Though he \\nwas careful with his words, telling them that he would do all he could to support the people of \\nMeluha, the public made their own interpretations. \\n\\nThe cursed Chandravanshis will finally be destroyed,’ said one man. \\n\\n‘We don’t have to worry about anything now. The Neelkanth will take care of every thing,’said \\na woman. \\n\\nSeated with Brahaspati and Sati on the speaker’s platform, Parvateshwar was deeply unhappy \\nat the public’s reaction. Turning to the chief scientist, he said, ‘Our entire society is based on laws \\nand we are not supposed to blindly follow anyone. We are expected to solve our problems \\nourselves and not hope for miracles from a solitary man. What has this man done to deserve such \\nblind faith?’ \\n\\n‘Parvateshwar,’said Brahaspati politely, for he greatly respected him. ‘I think Shiva is a good \\nman. I think he cares enough to want to do something. And aren’t good intentions the first step \\ntowards any good deed?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar didn’t completely agree. Never a believer in the legend of the Neelkanth, the \\ngeneral thought that every man or woman had to earn his station in life with training and \\npreparation, not just get it on a silver platter because of a blue throat. ‘Yes, that may be true. But \\nintentions aren’t enough. They have to be backed by ability as well. Here we are, putting an \\nuntrained man on a pedestal and acting as though he is our saviour. For all we know, he might lead \\nus to complete disaster. We are acting on faith. Not logic or laws or even experience.’ \\n\\n‘Sometimes one needs a little bit of faith when faced with a difficult situation. Rational answers \\ndon’t always work We also need a miracle.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘You ’re talking about miracles? A scientist?’ \\n\\n‘You can have scientific miracles too, Parvateshwar,’ smiled Brahaspati. \\n\\nParvateshwar was distracted by the sight of Shiva stepping off the platform. As he came down \\nthere was a surge of people wanting to touch his hand. The soldiers, led by Nandi and \\nVeerbhadra, were holding them back. There was one blind man amongst them who looted like he \\nmight be injured in the melee. \\n\\n‘Nandi, let that man through,’ said Shiva. \\n\\nNandi and Veerbhadra lowered the rope to let him in. \\n\\nAnother man shouted, ‘I am his son. He needs me to guide him.’ \\n\\n‘Let him in as well,’ said Shiva. \\n\\nThe son rushed in and held his father’s hand. The blind man, who seemed lost without his son’s \\nhand, smiled warmly as he recognised the familiar touch. He was led close to Shiva and the son \\nsaid, ‘Father, the Neelkanth is right in front of you. Can you sense his presence?’ \\n\\nCopious tears flowed from the blind man’s eyes. Without thinking, he bent down to try and \\ntouch Shiva’s feet. His son cried out in shockas he pulled the man backsharply. \\n\\n‘Father! ’ scolded the son. \\n\\nShiva was stunned by the harshness in the son’s tone compared to the loving manner in which \\nhe had spoken so far. ‘What happened?’ \\n\\n‘I am sorry, my Lord,’apologised the son. ‘He didn’t mean to. He just lost control due to your \\npresence.’ \\n\\n‘I am sorry, my Lord,’ said the blind man, his tears flowing stronger. \\n\\n‘Sorry for what?’ \\n\\n‘He is a vikarma, my Lord,’said his son, ‘ever since disease blinded him twenty years ago. He \\nshould not have tried to touch you.’ \\n\\nSati, who was now standing near Shiva, had heard the entire conversation. She felt sympathy \\nfor the blind man. She knew the torment of having even your touch considered impure. But what \\nhe had tried to do was illegal. \\n\\n‘I am sorry, my Lord,’continued the blind man. ‘But please don’t let your anger with me stop \\nyou from protecting our country. It is the greatest land that Parmatma created. Save it from the \\nevil Chandravanshis. Save us, my Lord.’ \\n\\nThe blind man continued to cry folding his hands in a penitent namaste. Shiva was shaken by \\nthe dignity of the blind man. \\n\\nHe still loves a country that treats him so unfairly. Why? Even worse he doesn’t even appear to \\nthink he’s being treated unfairly. \\n\\nTears welled up in Shiva’s eyes as he realised that he was looking at a man whom fate had \\nbeen very unkind to. \\n\\nI will stop this nonsense. \\n\\nShiva stepped forward and bent down. The flabbergasted son trembled in disbelief as he saw \\nthe Neelkanth touch the feet of his vikarma father. The blind man was at sea for a moment. When \\nhe did understand what the Neelkanth had done, his hand shot up to cover his mouth in shock. \\n\\nShiva rose and stood in front of the blind man. ‘Bless me, sir, so that I find the strength to fight \\nfor a man as patriotic as you.’ \\n\\nThe blind man stood dumb-struck His tears dried up in his bewilderment. He was about to \\n\\n\\n\\ncollapse when Shiva took a quickstep forward to hold him, lest he fall to the ground. The blind \\nman found the strength to say, ‘Vijayibhav May you be victorious. \\n\\nThe son caught hold of his father’s limp body as Shiva released him. The entire crowd was \\nstunned into silence by what the Neelkanth had done. Forget the gravity of touching a vikarma, the \\nNeelkanth had just asked to be blessed by one. Shiva turned to see Parvateshwar’s enraged face. \\nShiva had broken the law. Broken it brazenly and in public. Next to him stood Sati. Her face, her \\neyes, her entire demeanour expressionless. \\n\\nWhat the hell is she thinking? \\n\\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nBrahaspati and Sati entered Shiva’s chambers as soon as he was alone. Shiva’s smile at seeing \\nhis two favourite people in the world disappeared on hearing Sati’s voice, ‘You must get a \\nshudhikaran done.’ \\n\\nHe looted at her and answered simply, ‘No.’ \\n\\n‘No? What do you mean no?’ \\n\\n‘I mean No. Nahin. Nate,’ said Shiva, adding the words for ‘no’ in the Kashmiri and the \\nKotdwaar dialect, for good measure. \\n\\n‘Shiva,’said Brahaspati, keeping his composure. ‘This is no laughing matter. I agree with Sati. \\nThe governor too was worried about your safety and has arranged for a pandit. He waits outside \\nas we speak Get the ceremony done now.’ \\n\\n‘But I j ust said I don’t want to.’ \\n\\n‘Shiva,’said Sati, reverting to her usual tone. ‘I respect you immensely. Your valour. Your \\nintelligence. Your talent. But you are not above the law. You have touched a vikarma. You have \\nto get a shudhikaran. That is the law.’ \\n\\n‘Well if the law says that my touching that poor blind man is illegal, then the law is wrong! ’ \\n\\nSati was stunned into silence by Shiva’s attitude. \\n\\n‘Shiva, listen to me,’argued Brahaspati. ‘Not doing a shudhikaran can be harmful to you. You \\nare meant for bigger things. You are important to the future of India. Don’t put your own person \\nat risk out of obstinacy.’ \\n\\n‘It’s not obstinacy. You tell me, honestly, how can it harm me if I happened to touch a wronged \\nman, who I might add, still loves his country despite the way he has been ostracised and ill- \\ntreated?’ \\n\\n‘He may be a good man Shiva, but the sins of his previous birth will contaminate your fate,’ \\nsaid Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘Then let them! If the weight on that man’s shoulders lessens, I will feel blessed.’ \\n\\n‘What are you saying Shiva?’asked Sati. ‘Why should you carry the punishment of someone \\nelse’s sins?’ \\n\\n‘Firstly, I don’t believe in the nonsense that he was punished for the sins of his previous birth. He \\n\\n\\n\\nwas just infected by a disease, plain and simple. Secondly, if it is my choice to carry the weight \\nof someone else’s so called sins, why should it matter to anyone?’ \\n\\n‘It matters because we care about you! ’ cried Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘Come on Sati,’ said Shiva. ‘Don’t tell me you believe in this rubbish.’ \\n\\n‘It is not rubbish.’ \\n\\n‘Look, don’t you want me to fight for you? Stop this unfairness that your society has subjected \\nyou to.’ \\n\\n‘Is that what this is about? Me?’ asked Sati, outraged. \\n\\n‘No,’retorted Shiva immediately, then added. ‘Actually yes. This is also about you. It is about \\nthe vikarma and the unfairness that they have to face. I want to save them from leading the life of \\nan outcast.’ \\n\\n‘I DONT NEED YOUR PROTECTION! I CANNOT BE SAVED!’ shouted Sati, before \\nstorming out of the room. \\n\\nShiva glared at her retreating form in irritation. ‘What the hell is it with this woman?! ’ \\n\\n‘She’s right Shiva,’ advised Brahaspati. ‘Don’t go there.’ \\n\\n‘You agree with her on this vikarma business? Answer with your heart, Brahaspati. Don’t you \\nthink it is unfair?’ \\n\\n‘I wasn’t talking about that. I was talking about Sati.’ \\n\\nShiva continued to glare at Brahaspati defiantly. Everything in his mind, body and soul told him \\nthat he should pursue Sati. That his life would be meaningless without her. That his soul’s existence \\nwould be incomplete without her. \\n\\n‘Don’t go there, my friend,’ reiterated Brahaspati. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nThe caravan left the river city of Kotdwaar on a royal barge led and followed by two large \\nboats of equal size and grandeur as the royal vessel. Typical of the Meluhan security system, the \\nadditional boats were to confuse any attacker about which boat the royal family may be on. The \\nentire royal party was in the second boat. Each of the three large boats was manned by a brigade \\nof soldiers. Additionally, there were five small and quick cutter boats on both sides of the royal \\nconvoy, keeping pace and protecting the sides in case of an ambush. \\n\\n‘When the monsoon is not active, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati, ‘the rivers are the best way to \\ntravel. Though we have good roads connecting all major cities, it cannot match the rivers in terms \\nof speed and safety.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled at Ayurvati politely. He was not in the frame of mind for much conversation. Sati \\nhad not spoken to Shiva since that fateful day at Kotdwaar when he had refused to undergo a \\nshudhikaran. \\n\\nThe royal barge stopped at many cities along the river. The routine seemed much the same. \\nExtreme exuberance would manifest itself in each city on the arrival of the Neelkanth. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a kind of reaction unnatural in Meluha. But then, a Neelkanth didn’t grace the land every \\nday. \\n\\n‘Why?’ asked Shiva of Brahaspati, after many days of keeping quiet about the disquiet in his \\ntroubled heart. \\n\\n‘Why what?’ \\n\\n‘You know what I am talking about, Brahaspati,’ said Shiva, narrowing his eyes in irritation. \\n\\n‘She genuinely believes that she deserves to be a vikarma,’ answered Brahaspati with a sad \\nsmile. \\n\\n‘Why?’ \\n\\n‘Perhaps because of the manner in which she became a vikarma.’ \\n\\n‘How did it happen?’ \\n\\n‘It happened during her earlier marriage.’ \\n\\n‘What! Sati was married?! ’ \\n\\n’Yes. That was around ninety years back. It was a political marriage with one of the noble \\nfamilies of the empire. Her husband’s name was Chandandhwaj. She got pregnant and went to \\nthe Maika to deliver the child. It was the monsoon season. Unfortunately, the child was stillborn.’ \\n\\n‘Oh my god! ’ said Shiva, empathising with the pain Sati must have felt. \\n\\n‘But it was worse. On the same day, her husband, who had gone to the Narmada to pray for the \\nsafe birth of their child, accidentally drowned. On that cursed day, her life was destroyed.’ \\n\\nShiva stared at Brahaspati, too stunned to react. ‘She became a widow and was declared a \\nvikarma the same day.’ \\n\\n‘But how can the husband’s death be considered her fault?’ argued Shiva. ‘That is completely \\nridiculous.’ \\n\\n‘She wasn’t declared a vikarma because of her husband’s death. It was because she gave birth \\nto a stillborn child.’ \\n\\n‘But that could be due to any reason. Maybe there was a mistake that the local doctors \\ncommitted.’ \\n\\n‘That doesn’t happen in Meluha, Shiva,’ said Brahaspati calmly. ‘Having a stillborn child is \\nprobably one of the worst ways for a woman to become a vikarma. Only giving birth to a Naga \\nchild would be considered worse. Thank god that didn’t happen. Because then she would have \\nbeen completely ostracised from society.’ \\n\\n‘This has to be changed. The concept of vikarma is unfair.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati looted at his friend intensely. ‘You might save the vikarma, Shiva. But how do you \\nsave a woman who doesn’t want to be saved? She genuinely believes she deserves this \\npunishment.’ \\n\\n‘Why? I’m sure she is not the first Meluhan woman to give birth to a stillborn. There must have \\nbeen others before her. There will be many more after her.’ \\n\\n‘She was the first royal woman to give birth to a stillborn. Her fate has been a source of \\nembarrassment to the emperor. It raises questions about his ancestry ’ \\n\\n‘How would it raise questions about his lineage? Sati is not his birth daughter. She would also \\nhave come from Maika, right?’ \\n\\n‘No, my friend. That law was relaxed for families of nobility around two hundred and fifty \\nyears back. Apparently in the ‘national interest”, noble families were allowed to keep their birth- \\n\\n\\n\\nchildren. Some laws can be amended, provided ninety per cent of the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and \\nVaishyas above a particular chosen-tribe and job status vote for the change. There have been \\nrare instances of such unanimity. This was one of them. Only one man opposed this change.’ \\n‘Who?’ \\n\\n‘Lord Satyadhwaj, the grandfather of Parvateshwar. Their family had vowed not to have any \\nbirth children since this law was passed. Parvateshwar honours that promise to this day.’ \\n\\n‘But if the birth law could be changed,’said Shiva working things out, ‘why couldn’t the law of \\nvikarma?’ \\n\\n‘Because there aren’t enough noble families affected by that law. That is the harsh truth.’ \\n\\n‘But all this goes completely against Lord Ram’s teachings! ’ \\n\\n‘Lord Ram’s teachings also say that the concept of the vikarma is correct. Don’t you want to \\nquestion that?’ \\n\\nShiva glanced at Brahaspati silently, before looking out over the river. \\n\\nThere is nothing wrong with questioning Lord Ram’s laws, my friend,’said Brahaspati. ‘There \\nwere many times when he himself stood down because of someone else’s rationale. The question \\nis that what are your motives for wanting to change the law? Is it because you genuinely think the \\nlaw itself is unfair? Or is it because you are attracted to Sati and you want to remove an \\ninconvenient law which stands in your path.’ \\n\\n‘I genuinely think the vikarma law is unfair. I felt that from the moment I found out about it. \\nEven before I knew Sati was a vikarma.’ \\n\\n‘But Sati doesn’t think the law is unfair.’ \\n\\n‘But she is a good woman. She doesn’t deserve to be treated this way.’ \\n\\n‘She is not just a good woman. She is one of the finest I have ever met. She is beautiful, honest, \\nstraight-forward, brave and intelligent — everything a man could want in a woman. But you are \\nnot just any man. You are the Neelkanth.’ \\n\\nShiva turned around and rested his hands on the craft’s railing. He looked into the distance at the \\ndense forest along the riverbanks as their boat glided across the water. The soothing evening \\nbreeze fanned Shiva’s long locks. \\n\\n‘I’ve told you before, my friend,’ said Brahaspati. ‘Because of that unfortunate blue throat, \\nevery decision you tale has many ramifications. You have to thinkmany times before you act.’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt was late in the night. The royal convoy had just set sail from the city of Sutgengarh on the \\nIndus. The emotions at Sutgengarh had erupted in the now predictable routine of exuberance at \\nthe sight of the Neelkanth. The saviour of their civilisation had finally arrived. \\n\\nTheir saviour, however, was in his own private hell. Sati had maintained her distance from \\nShiva for the last few weeks. He was torn, experiencing pain and dismay at depths he didn’t think \\nfathomable. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe convoy’s next stop was the famous city of Mohan Jo Daro or the Platform of Mohan. The \\ncity, on the mighty Indus, was dedicated to a great philosopher-priest called Lord Mohan, who \\nlived in this region many thousands of years ago. Once he had met with the people of Mohan Jo \\nDaro, Shiva expressed a desire to visit the temple of Lord Mohan. This temple stood outside the \\nmain city platform, further down the Indus. The governor of Mohan Jo Daro had offered to tale \\nthe Lord Neelkanth there in a grand procession. Shiva however insisted on going alone. He felt \\ndrawn to the temple. He felt that it would have some solutions for his troubled heart. \\n\\nThe temple itself was simple. Much like Lord Mohan himself. A small non—descript structure \\nannounced itself as the birthplace of the sage. The only sign of the temple’s significance was the \\nmassive gates in the four cardinal directions of the compound. As instructed by Shiva, Nandi and \\nVeerbhadra, along with their platoon, waited outside. \\n\\nShiva, with his comforting cravat back around his neck, walled up the steps feeling tranquil \\nafter a long time. He rang the bell at the entrance and sat down against a pillar with his eyes shut \\nin quiet contemplation. Suddenly, an oddly familiar voice asked: ‘How are you, my friend?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14 \\n\\n\\nPandit of Mohan Jo Daro \\n\\n\\nShiva opened his eyes to behold a man who was almost a replica of the pandit he had met at the \\nBrahma temple, in what seemed like another life. He sported a similar long flowing white beard \\nand a big white mane. He wore a saffron dhoti and angvastram. The wizened face bore a calm \\nand welcoming smile. If it wasn’t for this pandit’s much taller frame, Shiva could have easily \\nmistaken him for the one he had met at the Brahma temple. \\n\\n‘How are you, my friend?’ repeated the pandit sitting down. \\n\\n‘I am alright, Panditji,’said Shiva, using the Indian term ji \\' as a form of respect. He couldn’t \\nfollow why, but the intrusion was welcome to him. It almost seemed as though he was drawn to \\nthis temple because he was destined to meet the pandit. ‘Do all pandits in Meluha lookalike?’ \\n\\nThe man smiled warmly. ‘Not all the pandits. Just us.’ \\n\\n‘And who might “;us\" be, Panditji?’ \\n\\n‘The next time you meet one of us, we will tell you,’ said the Pandit cryptically. ‘That is a \\npromise.’ \\n\\n‘Why not now?’ \\n\\n‘At this point of time, our identity is not important,’smiled the Pandit. What is important is that \\nyou are disturbed about something. Do you want to talkabout it?’ \\n\\nShiva tooka deep breath. Gut instinct told him that he could trust this man. \\n\\n‘There is this task that I supposedly have to do for Meluha.’ \\n\\n‘I know. Though I wouldn’t dismiss the Neelkanth’s role as a “task”. He does much more than \\nthat.’ Pointing at Shiva’s throat, the Pandit continued, ‘Pieces of cotton cannot cover divine \\nbrilliance.’ \\n\\nShiva looked up with a wry smile. ‘Well, Meluha does seem like a wonderful society. And I \\nwant to do all I can to protect it from evil.’ \\n\\n‘Then what is the problem?’ \\n\\n‘The problem is that I find some grossly unfair practices in this nearly perfect society. And this \\nis inconsistent with the ideals that Meluha aspires to.’ \\n\\n‘What practices are you referring to?’ asked the Pandit. \\n\\n‘For example, the way the vikarma are treated.’ \\n\\n‘Why is it unfair?’ \\n\\n‘How can anyone be sure that these people committed sins in their previous birth? And that \\ntheir present sufferings are a result of that? It might be sheer bad luck Or a random act of nature.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘You’re right. It could be. But do you think that the fate of the vikarma is about them \\npersonally?’ \\n\\n‘Isn’t it?’ \\n\\n‘No it isn’t,’explained the Pandit. ‘It is about the society as a whole. The vikarma acceptance of \\ntheir fate is integral to the stability of Meluha.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. \\n\\n‘What any successful society needs, O Neelkanth, is flexibility with stability. Why would you \\nneed flexibility? Because every single person has different dreams and capabilities. The birth son \\nof a warrior could have the talent to be a great businessman. Then society needs to be flexible \\nenough to allow this son to change his vocation from his father’s profession. Flexibility in a society \\nallows change, so that all its members have the space to discover their true selves and grow to \\ntheir potential. And if every person in a society achieves his true potential, society as a whole also \\nachieves its true potential.’ \\n\\n‘I agree.’ \\n\\nBut what does this have to do with the vikarma? \\n\\n‘I’ll come to the obvious question in a bit. Just bear with me,’said the Pandit. ‘If we believe that \\nflexibility is key to a successful society, the Maika system is designed to achieve it in practice. No \\nchild knows what the professions of his birth-parents are. They are independent to pursue what \\ntheir natural talent inspires them to do.’ \\n\\n‘I agree. The Maika system is almost breathtakingly fair. A person can credit or blame only \\nhimself for what he does with his life. Nobody else. But this is about flexibility. What about \\nstability ?’ \\n\\n‘Stability allows a person the freedom of choice, my friend. People can pursue their dreams \\nonly when they are living in a society where survival is not a daily threat. In a society without \\nsecurity and stability, there are no intellectuals or businessmen or artists or geniuses. Man is \\nconstantly in fight or flight mode. Nothing better than an animal. Where is the chance then to \\nallow ideas to be nurtured or dreams to be pursued? That is the way all humans were before we \\nformed societies. Civilisation is very fragile. All it takes is a few decades of chaos for us to forget \\nhumanity and turn into animals. Our base natures can take over very fast. We can forget that we \\nare sentient beings, with laws and codes and ethics.’ \\n\\n‘I understand. The tribes in my homeland were no better than animals. They didn’t even want \\nto live a better life!’ \\n\\n‘They didn’t know a better life was possible, Neelkanth. That is the curse of constant strife. It \\nmates us forget the most beautiful part of being human. That is why society must remain stable \\nso that we don’t put each other in a situation of having to fight for survival.’ \\n\\n‘All right. But why would letting people achieve their potential cause instability? In fact, it \\nshould mate people happier with their lives and hence society would become increasingly \\nsteady.’ \\n\\n‘True, but only partially. People are happy when they change their lives for the better. But \\nthere are two situations in which change can lead to chaos. First, when people face a change by \\nothers, situations that they cannot understand. This scares them almost as much as the fear of \\ndeath. When change happens too fast, they resist it.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, change forced by others is difficult to accept.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘And too rapid a change causes instability. That is the bedrock of Lord Ram’s way of life. \\nThere are laws which help a society change slowly and allow it to remain stable. At the same \\ntime, it allows its citizens the freedom to follow their dreams. He created an ideal balance of \\nstability and flexibility.’ \\n\\n‘You mentioned a second situation...’ \\n\\n‘The second is when people cannot mate the transition they want to improve their lives for \\nreasons beyond their control. Say there is an exceptional warrior who loses his hand-eye \\ncoordination due to a disease. He is still a fighter, but not extraordinary any more. The odds are \\nthat he will be frustrated about what he perceives as injustice meted out to him. He is likely to \\nblame his doctor, or even society at large. Many such discontented people can become a threat to \\nsociety as a whole.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. He didn’t like the logic. But he also knew that one of the main reasons the \\nPakratis had rejected the peace offer by his uncle years ago was because their diseased and old \\nchief was desperate to live up to his initial reputation of being an exceptional warrior who could \\nhave defeated the Gunas. \\n\\n‘Their combined rage can lead to unrest, even violence,’ said the Pandit. ‘Lord Ram sensed \\nthat. And that is why the concept of Vikarma came into being. If you mate a person believe that \\nhis misfortune in this birth is due to his sins in his previous birth, he will resign himself to his fate \\nand not vent his fury on society at large.’ \\n\\n‘But I disagree that ostracising the vikarma can work It would lead to more suppressed anger.’ \\n\\n‘But they are not ostracised. Their living is subsidised by the government. They can still interact \\nwith family members. They are allowed to gain personal excellence in their chosen fields, \\nwherever possible. They can also fight to protect themselves. What they can’t do is ever be in a \\nposition to influence others. And this system has worked for one thousand years. Do you know \\nhow common rebellion was in India before Lord Ram created this empire? And most of the \\ntimes, the rebellions were not led by farsighted men who thought they would create a better way \\nof life for the common man. They were led by men discontented with their lot in life. People \\nvery much like the vikarma. And these rebellions usually caused chaos and decades went by \\nbefore order was restored.’ \\n\\n‘So are you saying that anyone who is frustrated with life should simply resign himself to being \\na vikarma,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘Why?’ \\n\\n‘For the larger good of society ’ \\n\\nShiva was aghast. He could not believe what he was hearing. He deeply disliked the arguments \\nbeing presented to him. ‘I am sorry, but I think this system is completely unfair. I have heard that \\nalmost one twentieth of the people in Meluha are vikarma. Are you going to keep so many people \\nas outcast forever? This system needs to change.’ \\n\\n‘You can change it. You are the Neelkanth. But remember, no system is absolutely perfect. In \\nLord Ram’s time, a lady called Manthara triggered a series of events which led to the loss of \\nmillions of lives. She had suffered terribly due to her physical deformities. And then, fate put her \\nin a position of influence over a powerful queen and thus over the entire kingdom. Therefore, the \\nkarma of one maladjusted victim of fate led to the mass destruction that followed. Would it not \\nhave been better for everybody if this person had been declared a vikarma? There are no easy \\n\\n\\n\\nanswers. Having said that, maybe you are right. Maybe there are so many vikarma now that it \\ncan lead to a tipping point, tumble society into chaos. Do I have the solution to this problem? No. \\nMaybe you could find it.’ \\n\\nShiva turned his face away. He believed in his heart that the vikarma system was unfair. \\n\\n‘Are you concerned about all the vikarma, O Neelkanth?’ asked the Pandit. ‘Or just one in \\nparticular?’ \\n\\n\\n- xmw - \\n\\n\\n‘What is the Lord doing in there?’ asked Nandi. ‘He is taking too long.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know,’ said Veerbhadra. ‘All I know is that if Shiva says he needs to do something, I \\naccept it.’ \\n\\n‘Why do you call the Lord by his name?’ \\n\\n‘Because that is his name!’ \\n\\nNandi smiled at the simple answer and turned to lookat the temple. \\n\\n‘Tell me Captain,’ said Veerbhadra coming close to Nandi. ‘Is Krittika spoken for?’ \\n\\n‘Spoken for?’ \\n\\n‘I mean,’ continued Veerbhadra. ‘Is she off limits?’ \\n\\n‘Off limits?’ \\n\\n‘You know what I mean,’said Veerbhadra turning beet red. ‘She is a widow,’said Nandi. ‘Her \\nhusband died fifteen years back.’ \\n\\n‘Oh, that’s terrible!’ \\n\\n‘Yes, it is,’said Nandi, as he smiled at Veerbhadra. ‘But to answer your question, she is “not \\nspoken for” right now.’ \\n\\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\n‘My Lady, may I say something?’ asked Krittika. \\n\\nSati turned from the guest-room window to lookat Krittika with a surprised frown. ‘Have I ever \\nstopped you from speaking your mind? A true Suryavanshi always speaks her mind.’ \\n\\n‘Well,’ said Krittika. ‘Sometimes, it may not be that harmful to lose control of yourself.’ \\n\\nSati frowned even more. \\n\\nKrittika spoke quickly, before her courage deserted her. ‘Forget about him being the Neelkanth, \\nmy Lady. Just as a man, I thinkhe is the finest I have seen. He is intelligent and brave, funny and \\nkind, and worships the ground you walk on. Is that really so bad?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nSati glared at Krittika; she didn’t know if she was more upset at Krittika for what she was saying \\nor at herself for having feelings which were apparently so evident. \\n\\nKrittika continued, ‘Maybe, just maybe, breaking the rules can lead to happiness.’ \\n\\n‘I am a Suryavanshi,’ said Sati, her voice dropping. ‘Rules are all that I live by. What have I got \\nto do with happiness? Don’t ever dare to speak to me about this again! ’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘Yes, there is this particular vikarma,’ admitted Shiva. ‘But that is not why I think the vikarma \\nlaw is unfair.’ \\n\\n‘I know that,’ said the Pandit. ‘But I also know that what troubles you right now is your \\nrelationship with that one in particular. You don’t want her to think that you would change the law, \\nhowever j ustified, j ust to get her. Because if Sati believes that, she will never come to you.’ \\n\\n‘How do you know her name?’ asked Shiva, flabbergasted. \\n\\n‘We know many things, my friend.’ \\n\\n‘My entire life is meaningless without her.’ \\n\\n‘I know,’ smiled the Pandit. ‘Perhaps I can help you.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. This was unexpected. \\n\\n‘You want her to reciprocate your love. But how can she when you don’t even understand her?’ \\n\\n‘I think I understand her. I love her.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, you do love her. But you don’t understand her. You don’t know what she wants.’ \\n\\nShiva kept quiet. He knew the Pandit was right. He was thoroughly confused about Sati. \\n\\n‘You can hazard a guess towards what she wants,’ continued the Pandit, ‘with the help of the \\ntheory of transactions.’ \\n\\nWhat?’ asked a flummoxed Shiva. \\n\\n‘It makes up the fabric of society.’ \\n\\n‘Excuse me, but what does this have to do with Sati?’ \\n\\n‘Indulge me for a little while, Neelkanth,’said the Pandit. You know the cloth that you wear is \\ncreated when cotton threads are woven together, right?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ answered Shiva. \\n\\n‘Similarly, transactions are threads that when woven together mate up a society, its culture. Or \\nin the case of a person, weaves together their character.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded. \\n\\n‘If you want to know the strength of a cloth, you inspect the quality of its weave. If you want to \\nunderstand a person’s character, look closely at their interpersonal behaviour or their \\ntransactions.’ \\n\\n‘Alright,’ said Shiva slowly, absorbing the Pandit’s words. ‘But transactions are...’ \\n\\n‘I’ll explain,’ interrupted the Pandit. Transactions are interactions between two individuals. It \\ncould be trading goods, like a Shudra farmer offering grain for money from a Vaishya. But it \\n\\n\\n\\ncould also be beyond material concerns, like a Kshatriya offering protection to a society in return \\nfor power.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded in agreement. ‘Transactions are about give and take.’ \\n\\n‘Exactly. So going by this logic, if you want something from someone, you have to give that \\nperson something they want.’ \\n\\n‘So what do you think she wants?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Try and understand Sati’s transactions. What do you think she wants?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know. She is very confusing’ \\n\\n‘No, she isn’t. There is a pattern. Think She is probably the most eminent vikarma in history. \\nShe has the power to rebel if she wants to. She certainly has the spirit since she never backs off \\nfrom a fight. But she does not rebel against the vikarma law. Neither does she fade into the \\nbackground like most vikarmas and live her life in anonymity. She follows the commandments, \\nand yet, she does not whine and complain to others. However unfairly life treats her, she \\nconducts herself with dignity. Why?’ \\n\\n‘Because she is a righteous person?’ \\n\\n‘That she is, no doubt. But that is not the reason. Remember, in a transaction, you give \\nsomething because you want something in return. She is accepting an unfair law without trying to \\nmake anyone feel guilty about it. And most importantly, she continues to use her talents to \\ncontribute to the good of society whenever she can. What do you think a person who is giving all \\nthis in her transactions with society wants in return?’ \\n\\n‘Respect,’ answered Shiva. \\n\\n‘Exactly!’beamed the Pandit. ‘And what do you think you do when you try to protect such a \\nperson?’ ‘Disrespect her.’ \\n\\n‘Absolutely! I know it comes naturally to you to want to protect any good person who appears \\nin need. But control that feeling in relation to Sati. Respect her. And she will feel irresistibly drawn \\ntowards you. She gets many things from the people who love her. What she doesn’t get is what \\nshe craves the most — respect.’ \\n\\nShiva looked at the Pandit with a grateful smile. He had found his answer. \\n\\nRespect. \\n\\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nAfter two weeks, the Neelkanth’s convoy reached the city of Karachapa at the confluence of \\nthe Indus into the Western Sea. It was a glittering city which had long grown beyond the one \\nplatform it was built on. The Dwitiya or second platform, had been erected fifty years ago on an \\neven grander scale than the first. The Dwitiya platform was where the Karachapa elite lived. The \\nGovernor, a diminutive Vaishya called Jhooleshwar, had heard of and followed the new tradition \\nof receiving the Neelkanth outside the city. \\n\\nKarachapa, with its hundred thousand citizens, was at its heart a frontier trading city. Therefore \\n\\n\\n\\nit was an act of foresight by Lord Brahmanayak, Emperor Daksha’s father, to have appointed a \\nVaishya as its governor over a hundred years ago. Jhooleshwar had ruled the city extraordinarily \\nwell, gilding its fate in gold and was considered its wisest and most efficient governor ever. \\nKarachapa had long overtaken Lothal on the eastern part of the empire to become Meluha’s \\npremier city of commerce. While foreigners such as Mesopotamians and Egyptians were \\nallowed into this liberal city, they were not allowed to travel further into Meluha without express \\nroyal permission. \\n\\nJhooleshwar escorted the Neelkanth on an excursion to the Western Sea on his very first day in \\nKarachapa. Shiva had never seen the sea and was fascinated by the near infinite expanse of \\nwater. He spent many hours at the port where Jhooleshwar proudly expounded on the various \\ntypes of ships and vessels manufactured at the shipyard attached to the Karachapa port. \\nBrahaspati accompanied them to the port to check on the imports due for him from the \\nMesopotamian merchants. \\n\\nAt the evening state dinner organised for Shiva, Jhooleshwar proudly announced that a jagna, a \\nceremonial fire sacrifice, was being organised the next day in honour of the Neelkanth, under the \\nauspices of Lord Varun and the legendary Ashwini Kumar twins. The Ashwini Kumar twins \\nwere celebrated ancient seafarers who had navigated ocean routes from Meluha to Mesopotamia \\nand beyond. Their maps, guidance and stories were a source of inspiration and learning for this \\ncity of seamen. \\n\\nAfter dinner, Shiva visited the chambers where Sati and Krittika were housed. \\n\\n‘I was wondering,’said Shiva, still careful with Sati since she had gone back to being formal \\nwith him, ‘will you be coming to the yagna tomorrow?’ \\n\\n‘I am very sorry, Lord Neelkanth,’said Sati courteously. ‘But it may not be possible for me to \\nattend the ceremony. I am not allowed to attend such yagnas.’ \\n\\nShiva was about to say that nobody would question her since she would be attending with the \\nNeelkanth. But he thought better of it. ‘Perhaps we could have a dance practise tomorrow? I \\ncannot remember the last time we had a dance session.’ \\n\\n‘That would be nice. I have not had the benefit of your instruction in a long time,’ said Sati. \\n\\nShiva nodded unhappily at Sati — the freeze in their relationship tormented him. Bidding \\ngoodbye, he turned to leave. \\n\\nKrittika glanced at Sati, shaking her head imperceptibly. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15 \\n\\n\\nTrial by Fire \\n\\nThe little boy hurried through a dusty goat trail, trying to avoid the sharp stones, bundling into his \\nfur coat. The dense, wet forest encroached on the path menacingly. It was difficult to see beyond \\nthe trees lining the narrow path. The boy was sure that there were terrible monsters lurking in the \\ndense foliage, waiting to pounce on him if he slowed down. His village was but a few hours away. \\nThe sun was fast setting behind the mountains. Monsters love the darkness— he had heard his \\nmother and grandmother say repeatedly when he was being difficult. He would have liked being \\naccompanied by an elder, as monsters didn’t trouble the elders. \\n\\nHis heart skipped a beat as he heard a strange heaving sound. He immediately drew out his \\nshort sword, suspecting an attack from behind. His friends had heard many stories about the \\nmonsters of the forests. The cowards never attackedfrom the front. \\n\\nHe stood still straining to determine the direction of the sound. It had a peculiar repetitive \\nrhythm and seemed vaguely familiar. He felt as though he had heard it before. The heaving was \\nnow accompanied by a heavy grunting male voice. This was not a monster! The boy felt \\nexcitement run through his body. He had heard his friends whisper in giggles about it, but never \\nseen the act himself. This was his chancel \\n\\nHe crept slowly into the foliage, his sword dangling by his side. He did not have to go too far \\nwhen he came upon the source of the sound. It came from a small clearing. He bid behind a tree \\ntrunk and peeped. \\n\\nIt was a couple. They seemed to be in a hurry. They had not even disrobed completely. The \\nman was extraordinarily hairy — almost like a bear. The boy could see just his back from this \\nangle. He had a frontal view of the woman. She was astonishingly beautiful. Her wavy hair, long \\nand lustrous. The partly torn blouse revealed a firm breast, with deep red welts due to the brutal \\nintercourse. Her skirt had been ripped and revealed exquisite long legs. The boy was excited \\nbeyond imagination. Wait till his best friend Bhadra heard of this! \\n\\nAs he enjoyed the show, his disquiet grew. Something seemed amiss. The man was in the \\nthroes of passion while the woman lay passive — almost dead. Her hands lay lifeless by her side. \\nHer mouth was tightly shut. She was not whispering encouragements to her lover. Were those \\ntears of ecstasy rolling down her cheeks’? Or was she being forced? But how could that be? The \\nman’s knife lay within the woman’s reach. She could have picked up the blade and stabbed him if \\nshe wanted. \\n\\nThe boy shookhis head. He tried to silence his conscience. ‘Just shut up. Ij et me look.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then came the moment that would haunt him for the rest of his life. The woman’s eyes \\nsuddenly fell upon him. \\n\\n‘HELP! ’ she cried out, ‘Please help! ’ \\n\\nThe startled boy fell back, dropping his sword. The hairy monster turned to see who the woman \\nwas calling. The boy quickly picked up his sword and fled, ignoring the searing pain on his frost¬ \\nbitten foot as he ran. He was terrified at the thought that the man was chasing him. He could hear \\nthe man’s heavy breathing. \\n\\nThe boy leapt onto the goat trail and sped towards his village. He could still hear the heavy \\nbreathing. It was drawing closer every second. The boy suddenly swerved to his left, pivoted and \\nslashed backwith his sword. \\n\\nThere was nobody there. No sound of heavy breathing. The only sound was the haunting plea \\nof a distraught woman. \\n\\n‘Help! Please help!’ \\n\\nThe little boy looted back. That poor woman. \\n\\n‘Go back! Help her! ’ cried his inner voice. \\n\\nHe hesitated for a moment. Then turned and fled towards his village. \\n\\nNO! GO BACK! HELP HER! \\n\\nShiva woke up sweating, his heart pounding madly. He instinctively turned around, wanting \\ndesperately to go back to that dreadful day. To redeem himself. But there would be no \\nredemption. The woman’s terrified face came flooding back. He shut his eyes. But how do you \\nshut your eyes to an image branded on your mind? \\n\\nHe pulled his knees up and rested his head on them. Then he did the only thing that helped. He \\ncried. \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\nThe yagna platform had been set up at the central square of the Dwitiya platform. For \\nKarachapa, it was not the usual austere affair typical of Meluha. The frontier city had decorated \\nthe area with bright colours that vied for attention. The platform itself had been painted in a bright \\ngolden hue. Colourfully decorated poles, festooned with flowers, held aloft a shamiana, a cloth \\ncanopy. Red and blue pennants, with the Suryavanshi symbol painted on, hung proudly from \\nmany poles. The entire atmosphere was that of pomp and show. \\n\\nJhooleshwar received Shiva at the head of the platform and guided him to his ritual seat at the \\nyagna. At the governor\\'s repeated requests, Shiva had removed his cravat for the duration of the \\nceremony. Parvateshwar and Brahaspati sat to the right of the Neelkanth while Jhooleshwar and \\nAyurvati sat to his left. Nandi and Veerbhadra had also been invited to sit behind Shiva. Though \\nthis was unorthodox, Jhooleshwar had acceded to the Neelkanth’s request. Jhooleshwar governed \\na cosmopolitan border city and believed that many of the strict Meluhan laws could be bent \\nslightly for the sate of expediency. His liberal attitude had made Karachapa a magnet for people \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom a wide variety of races and a hub for the exchange of goods, services and ideas. \\n\\nShiva looted towards Sati’s balcony, which overlooted the central square in the distance. \\nThough Sati was not allowed to step on the platform while the yagna was being conducted, she \\ncould look on at the proceedings from the safe distance of her chambers. Shiva noticed her \\nstanding behind the balcony curtain, with Krittika by her side, observing the proceedings. \\n\\nAs was the custom before such a yagna, the pandit stood up and asked formally, ‘If anybody \\nhere has any objection to this yagna, please speaknow. Or forever hold your peace.’ \\n\\nThis was j ust a traditional question, which wasn’t actually supposed to be answered. Hence \\nthere was an audible, collective groan when a voice cried out loudly, ‘I object’ \\n\\nNobody needed to look to recognise where the voice came from. It was Tarak, an immigrant \\nfrom the ultra-conservative northwest regions of the empire. Since Tarak had come to \\nKarachapa, he had taken it upon himself to be the ‘moral police’ of this ‘decadent city of sin’. \\n\\nShiva strained his neck to see who had objections. He saw Tarak standing at the back, at the \\nedge of the puja platform, very close to Sati’s balcony. He was a giant of a man with a fair face \\ncut up brutally due to a lifetime of strife, an immense stomach and a miner’s bulging muscular \\narms. He cut an awesome figure. It was obvious, without even looking at his amulets, that Tarak \\nwas a Kshatriya who had made his living working in the lower rungs of the army. \\n\\nJhooleshwar glared at Tarak in exasperation. ‘What is it now? This time we have ensured that \\nwe have not used the white Chandra vanshi colours in our decorations. Or do you think the water \\nbeing used for the ceremony is not at the correct temperature as per the Vedas?’ \\n\\nThe gathering sniggered. Parvateshwar looted at Jhooleshwar sharply. Before he could \\nreprimand the Governor for his cavalier reference to the Vedas, Tarak spoke up. ‘The law says \\nno viterma should be allowed on the yagna platform.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’said Jhooleshwar. ‘And unless you have been declared a vikarma, I don’t think that law is \\nbeing broken.’ \\n\\n‘Yes it is!’ \\n\\nThere were shocked murmurs from the congregation. Jhooleshwar raised his hand. \\n\\n‘Nobody is a vikarma here, Tarak,’ said Jhooleshwar. ‘Now please sit down.’ \\n\\n‘Princess Sati defiles the yagna with her presence.’ \\n\\nShiva and Parvateshwar looted sharply at Tarak Jhooleshwar was as stunned as the rest of the \\nassembly by Tarak’s statement. ‘Tarak!’said Jhooleshwar. ‘You go too far. Princess Sati is \\nconfined in the guest-house, abiding by the laws of the yagna. She is not present on the yagna \\nplatform. Now sit down before I have you whipped.’ \\n\\n‘On what charge will you have me whipped, Governor?’yelled Tarak ‘Standing up for the law \\nis not a crime in Meluha.’ \\n\\n‘But the law has not been broken! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes it has. The exact words of the law is that no vikarma can be on the same platform while a \\nyagna is being conducted. The yagna is being conducted on the Dwitiya platform of the city. By \\nbeing on the same platform, the princess defiles the yagna.’ \\n\\nTarak was technically correct. Most people interpreted that law to mean that a vikarma could \\nnot be on the prayer ceremony platform. However, since Karachapa, like most Meluhan cities, \\nwas built on a platform, a strict interpretation of the law would mean that Sati should not be \\nanywhere on the entire Dwitiya platform. To keep the yagna legal, she would either have to move \\n\\n\\n\\nto the other platform of the city or outside the city walls. \\n\\nJhooleshwar was momentarily taken aback as Tarak’s objection was accurate in principle. He \\ntried a rally weakly. ‘Come, come Tarak You are being too conscientious. I think that is too strict \\nan interpretation. I think..’ \\n\\n‘No, Shri Jhooleshwarji,’ reverberated a loud voice through the gathering. \\n\\nEverybody turned to see where the sound came from. Sati, who had come out on her balcony, \\ncontinued. ‘Please accept my apologies for interrupting you, Governor,’said Sati with a formal \\nnamaste. ‘But Tarak’s interpretation of the law is fair. I am terribly sorry to have disturbed the \\nyagna. My entourage and I shall leave the city immediately. We will return by the beginning of \\nthe third prahar, by which time the ceremony should be over.’ \\n\\nShiva clenched his fist. He frantically wanted to wring Tarak’s neck but he controlled himself \\nwith superhuman effort. Within minutes Sati was out of the guest-house, along with Krittika and \\nfive personal bodyguards. Shiva turned to look at Nandi and Veerbhadra, both of whom rose to \\njoin Sati. They understood that Shiva wanted them to ensure that she was safe outside the city. \\n\\n‘It is disgusting that you did not realise this yourself,’Taraksaid scornfully to Sati. What kind of \\na princess are you? Don’t you respect the law?’ \\n\\nSati looted at Tarak Her face calm. She refused to be drawn into a debate and waited patiently \\nfor her guards to prepare the horses. \\n\\n‘I don’t understand what a vikarma woman is doing travelling with the convoy of the Neelkanth. \\nShe is polluting the entire journey,’ raged Tarak \\n\\n‘Enough! ’ intervened Shiva. ‘Princess Sati is leaving with dignity. Stop your diatribe right now.’ \\n\\n‘I will not!’screeched Tarak What kind of a leader are you? You are challenging Lord Ram’s \\nlaws.’ \\n\\n‘Tarak 1 ’yelled Jhooleshwar. ‘The Lord Neelkanth has the right to challenge the law. If you \\nvalue your life, you will not defy his authority ’ \\n\\n‘I am a Meluhan,’ shrieked Tarak ‘It is my right to challenge anyone breaking the law. A dhobi, \\na mere washerman, challenged Lord Ram. It was his greatness that he acceded to the man’s \\nobjection and renounced his wife. I would urge the Neelkanth to learn from Lord Ram’s example \\nand use his brains for making decisions.’ \\n\\n‘ENOUGH TARAK! ’ erupted Sati. \\n\\nThe entire congregation was stunned into silence by Tarak’s remark But not Sati. Something \\ninside her snapped. She had tolerated too many insults for too long. And she had endured them \\nwith quiet dignity. But this time, this man had insulted Shiva. Her Shiva, she finally acknowledged \\nto herself. \\n\\n‘I invoke the right of Agnipariksha ’ said Sati, back in control. \\n\\nThe stunned onlookers could not believe their ears. A trial by fire! \\n\\nThis was getting worse and worse. Under Agnipariksha, an unfairly injured soul could \\nchallenge their tormentor to a duel. It was called Agnipariksha as combat would take place within \\na ring of fire. There was no escape from the ring. The duellists had to keep fighting till one person \\nsurrendered or died. An Agnipariksha was extremely rare these days. And for a woman to invote \\nthe right was almost unheard of. \\n\\n‘There is no reason for this, my lady,’pleaded Jhooleshwar. Just like his subjects, he was \\nterrified that Princess Sati might be killed in his city. For the gargantuan Tarak would certainly \\n\\n\\n\\nslay her. The Emperor’s wrath would be terrible. Turning to Tarak, Jhooleshwar ordered, ‘You \\nwill not accept this challenge.’ \\n\\n‘And be called a coward?’ \\n\\n‘You want to prove your bravery?’spoke Parvateshwar for the first time. ‘Then fight me. I will \\nact as Sati’s second for the challenge.’ \\n\\n‘Only I have the right to appoint a second ,pitratulya ’ said Sati, reverentially referring to \\nParvateshwar as being ‘like a father’. Turning to Tarak, she said, ‘I am appointing no second. You \\nwill fight with me.’ \\n\\n‘You will do no such thing Tarak,’ Brahaspati objected this time. \\n\\n‘Tarak, the only reason you wouldn’t want to fight is if you are afraid of being killed,’said \\nShiva. \\n\\nEvery person turned towards the Neelkanth, shocked by his words. Turning to Sati, Shiva \\ncontinued, ‘Citizens of Karachapa, I have seen the Princess fight. She can defeat anyone. Even \\nthe gods.’ \\n\\nSati stared at Shiva, shocked. \\n\\n‘I accept the challenge,’ growled Tarak. \\n\\nSati nodded at Tarak, climbed on her white steed and turned to leave. At the edge of the square, \\nshe pulled up her horse and turned to take one more look at Shiva. She smiled at him, turned and \\nrode away. \\n\\n\\n— *@m — \\n\\nIt was the beginning of the third prahar as Shiva and Brahaspati stole quietly into the local \\nvarjish graha, the exercise hall , to observe Tarak exercising with two partners. The day’s yagna \\nhad been a disaster. With everyone petrified that the princess would die the next day, no one was \\ninclined to participate in the ceremony. However, as the yagna had been called, it had to be \\nconducted or the gods would be offended. The congregation went through the motions and the \\nyagna was called to a close. \\n\\nTarak’s famed fearsome blows on his hapless partners filled Brahaspati’s soul with dread and \\nhe came to an immediate decision. ‘I’ll assassinate him tonight. She will not die tomorrow’ \\n\\nShiva turned in stunned disbelief to the chief scientist. ‘Brahaspati? What are you saying?’ \\n\\n‘Sati is too noble to meet a fate such as this. I am willing to sacrifice my life and reputation for \\nher.’ \\n\\n‘But you are a Brahmin. You are not supposed to kill.’ \\n\\n‘I’ll do it for you,’whispered Brahaspati, emotions clouding his judgement. You will not lose \\nher, my friend.’ \\n\\nShiva came close to Brahaspati and hugged him. ‘Don’t corrupt your soul, my friend. I am not \\nworth such a big sacrifice.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati clung to Shiva. \\n\\n\\n\\nStepping back, Shiva whispered, ‘In any case, your sacrifice is not required. For as sure as the \\nsun rises in the east, Sati will defeat Taraktomorrow.’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\nA few hours into the third prahar, Sati returned to the guest house. She did not go up to her \\nroom, but summoned Nandi and Veerbhadra to the central courtyard, drew her sword and began \\nher practise with them. \\n\\nA little later Parvateshwar waited in, looking broken. His expression clearly conveyed his fear \\nthat this might be the last time he would talk to Sati. She stopped practising, sheathed her sword \\nand folded her hands into a respectful namaste. ‘Pitratulya,’ she whispered. \\n\\nParvateshwar came close to Sati, his face distraught. She could not be sure but it seemed as \\nthough he had been crying. She had never seen even a hint of a tear in his confident eyes. \\n\\n‘My child,’ mumbled Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘I am doing what I think is right,’ said Sati. ‘I am happy’ \\n\\nParvateshwar couldn’t find the strength to say anything. For a brief moment, he considered \\nassassinating Tarak at night. But that would be illegal. \\n\\nJust then, Shiva and Brahaspati waited in. Shiva noticed Parvateshwar’s face. This was the first \\ntime he had seen any sign of weakness in the general. While he could understand Parvateshwar’s \\npredicament, he did not like the effect it was having on Sati. \\n\\n‘I am sorry I am late,’ said Shiva cheerily. \\n\\nEveryone turned to look at him. \\n\\n‘Actually, Brahaspati and I had gone to the Lord Varun temple to pray for Tarak,’said Shiva. \\nWe prayed that the journey his soul would take to the other world would be comfortable.’ \\n\\nSati burst out laughing. So did the rest of the party in the courtyard. \\n\\n‘Bhadra, you are not the right opponent for the practise,’said Shiva. ‘You move too fast. Nandi \\nyou duel with the princess. And control your agility.’ \\n\\nTurning to Sati, Shiva continued, ‘I saw Tarak practise. His blows have tremendous power. But \\nthe force of the blows slows him down. Turn his strength into his weakness. Use your agility \\nagainst his movements.’ \\n\\nSati nodded, absorbing every word. She resumed her practise with Nandi. Moving rapidly \\ncompared to Nandi’s slower movements, Sati was able to succeed in a strike that could be kill. \\n\\nSuddenly, an idea struck Shiva. Instructing Nandi to stop, he asked Sati, ‘Are you allowed to \\nchoose the combat weapon?’ \\n\\nYes. It’s my prerogative as I threw the challenge.’ \\n\\n‘Then choose the knife. It will reduce the reach of his strikes while you can move in and out \\nmuch quieter.’ \\n\\n‘That’s brilliant! ’ concurred Parvateshwar, while Brahaspati nodded. \\n\\nSati signalled her agreement immediately. Almost at the same instant, Veerbhadra emerged \\n\\n\\n\\nwith two knives. Giving one to Nandi, he gave the other to Sati. ‘Practise, my Lady.’ \\n\\n\\n— xmw - \\n\\nSati and Tarakstood at the centre of a circular stadium. This was not the main Rangbhoomi of \\nKarachapa, which was gargantuan in its proportions. This one had been constructed next to the \\nmain stadium, for music concerts that the Mesopotamian immigrants in Karachapa loved. The \\narena was of the exact dimensions required for an agnipariksha. Not so big that a person could \\nsimply steer clear of the other contestant and not too small so that the combat would end fast. \\nThere were stands around the ground and a capacity crowd of over twenty thousand had come to \\nwatch the most important duel in Karachapa for the last five hundred years. \\n\\nThere was a prayer on every lip. Let Father Manu cause a miracle so that Princess Sati would \\nwin. Or at the very least. Eve. Both Tarak and Sati greeted each other with a namaste, repeating \\nan ancient pledge to fight with honour. Then, turning to the statue of Lord Varun at the top of the \\nmain stand they bowed, asking for blessings from the God of the Water and the Seas. Jhooleshwar \\nhad vacated his ceremonial seat right below the statue of Lord Varun for Shiva. The governor sat \\nto Shiva’s left with Ayurvati and Krittika to his left. Brahaspati and Parvateshwar sat to Shiva’s \\nright. Nandi and Veerbhadra were in their now famiEar position, behind Shiva. A bird courier had \\nbeen sent to Daksha the previous day, informing him of the duel. However, there wasn’t enough \\ntime to expect a reply. \\n\\nAt long last, Jhooleshwar stood up. He was nervous about the agnipariksha, but appeared \\ncomposed. As per custom, he raised a balled fist to his heart and boomed: ‘Satya! Dharma! \\nMaanl\\' An invocation to Truth. Duty. Honour. \\n\\nThe rest of the stadium rang in agreement. ‘Satya! Dharma! Maan!’ \\n\\nTarakand Sati echoed. ‘Satya! Dharma! Maan!’ \\n\\nJhooleshwar nodded to the stadium keeper who lit the ceremonial oil lamp with the holy fire. \\nThe lamp spilled its fire on to the oil channel; the periphery of the central ground was aflame. \\nThe ring for the pariksha had been set. \\n\\nJhooleshwar turned to Shiva. ‘My Lord, your instructions to start the duel.’ \\n\\nShiva looked at Sati with a confident smile. Then turning to the stadium, he declared loudly, ‘In \\nthe purifying fire of Lord Agni, truth will always triumph! ’ \\n\\nTarakand Sati immediately drew their knives. Tarak held his knife in front of him, like most \\ntraditional fighters. He had chosen a strategy that played to his strengths. Keeping his knife in \\nfront of him allowed him to strike the moment Sati came close. He did not stir too much, allowing \\nSati to mate her moves in front of him. \\n\\nSati, breaking all known rules of combat, held her knife behind her. She shifted the knife \\ncontinuously from one hand to the other, while keeping a safe distance from her opponent. The \\naim was to confuse Tarak about the direction of her attack Tarak on the other hand was watching \\nSati’s movements like a hawk He saw her right arm flex. The knife was now in her right hand. \\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Sati leapt to the left. Tarak remained stationary. He knew that with her right hand \\nholding the knife, the leftward movement was a feint. She would have to move to the right to bring \\nher knife into play. Sure enough, Sati quickly moved to the right and brought in her arm up in a \\nstabbing motion. Tarak was prepared. Shifting his knife quickly to his left arm, he slashed \\nviciously, cutting Sati across her torso. It wasn’t a deep cut, but it appeared to hurt. A collective \\ngasp went out from the audience. \\n\\nSati retreated and rallied. She moved the knife to her back again, transferring it from one hand \\nto the other. Tarak kept a close eye on her arms. The knife was in her left hand. He expected her \\nto move to the right, which she did. He remained immobile, waiting for her to swerve suddenly to \\nher left. She did, swinging her left arm as she moved. Tarak acted before her arm could even \\ncome close enough to do any damage. He swung ferociously with his right arm and cut her deep \\nin the left shoulder. Sati retreated rapidly as the congregation moaned in horror. Some shut their \\neyes. They could not bear to look anymore. Most were praying fervently. If it had to be done, let \\nit be done swiftly and not in a slow painful manner. \\n\\n‘What is she doing?’whispered a panic-stricken Brahaspati to Shiva. ‘Why is she charging in so \\nrecklessly?’ \\n\\nShiva turned to look at Brahaspati, also noticing Parvateshwar’s face. Parvateshwar had a \\nsurprised, yet admiring grin on his face. Unlike Brahaspati, he knew what was going on. Turning \\nbackto lookatthe duel, Shiva whispered, ‘She’s laying a trap.’ \\n\\nAt the centre, Sati was still transferring the knife between her hands behind her back She \\nfeigned a move from her right to the left, but this time did not transfer the knife. She flexed her \\nleft arm, keeping the right arm holding the knife loose and relaxed. \\n\\nTarak was watching Sati closely, confident that he was going to slowly bleed her to death. He \\nbelieved the knife was in her left hand. He waited for her to move right, then left, which she did in \\na swift veer. Expecting her left arm to come in, he sliced with his right hand. Sati neatly \\npirouetted back Before a surprised Tarak could react, Sati had leapt to her right and brought her \\nright hand in brutally onto Tarak’s chest. The knife pierced Tarak’s lung. The shock of the blow \\nimmobilised Tarak Blood spurted from his mouth. He dropped his knife and staggered back Sati \\nruthlessly maintained the pressure and dug the knife in deeper, right up to the hilt. \\n\\nTarak stumbled back and collapsed to the ground, motionless. The entire stadium was stunned. \\nSati’s face had the expression of the mother goddess in fury. Eighty-five years of repressed \\nanger had surfaced in that instant. She pulled the knife out, slowly twisting it to inflict maximum \\ndamage. Blood spewed out from Tarak’s mouth at an alarming rate. She raised the knife with both \\nher hands. All she had to do was bring it down on his heart and Tarak would meet his mater. Then \\nsuddenly, her expression became calm again. It was almost as if someone had sucked out all the \\nnegative energy inside her. She turned around. Shiva, the destroyer of evil, sat on his throne, \\nstaring at her with a slight smile. \\n\\nThen she looted at Tarak, and whispered. ‘I forgive you.’ \\n\\nThe stadium erupted in joy. Even if Lord Varun had himself scripted the fight, it wouldn’t have \\nbeen as perfect. It had everything that the Suryavanshis held dear. Defiant when under pressure, \\nyet magnanimous in victory. \\n\\nSati raised her knife and shouted, ‘Jai Shri Ram! ’ \\n\\nThe entire stadium repeated, ‘Jai Shri Ram! ’ \\n\\n\\n\\nSati turned towards Shiva and roared once again, ‘Jai Shri Ram! ’ \\n\\nMai...,’ Shiva’s words were clogged by the knot in his throat. \\n\\nThe Lord won’t mind this time if I don’t complete the cry. \\n\\nShiva glanced away from Sati, lest he show his tears to the woman he loved. Regaining control \\nof himself, he looked back at her with a radiant smile. Sati continued to stare at Shiva. Emotions \\nthat had been dormant in her for too long rippled through her being as she saw Shiva’s admiration. \\nWhen she couldn’t bear it any longer, she shut her eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16 \\n\\n\\nThe Sun & Earth \\n\\nThere was an impromptu celebration that night in Karachapa. Their princess was safe. The \\ninsufferable Tarak had been defeated. Many people in Karachapa believed that even his own \\nmother must have loathed the surly preacher. He had few supporters in the liberal city. But there \\nwere rules for duels. Hence the moment Sati had forgiven Tarak, paramedics had rushed in to \\ntake him to the hospital. Surgeons had laboured for she hours to save his life. To much dismay for \\nthe town folk, they had succeeded. \\n\\n‘Have you heard about the poem of the sun and the earth?’ Sati asked Shiva. \\n\\nThey were standing on the balcony of the governor’s palace while a boisterous party raged \\ninside. \\n\\n‘No,’ said Shiva with a seductive grin, corning a little closer to her. ‘But I’d love to hear it’ \\n\\n‘Apparently the earth sometimes thinks of the possibility of coming closer to the sun,’said Sati. \\n‘But she can’t do that. She is so base and his brilliance so searing, that she will cause destruction if \\nshe draws him closer.’ \\n\\nWhat now? \\n\\n‘I disagree,’said Shiva. ‘I think the sun burns only as long as the earth is close to him. If the \\nearth wasn’t there, there would be no reason for the sun to exist.’ \\n\\n‘The sun doesn’t exist just for the earth. It exists for every single planet in the solar system.’ \\n\\n‘Isn’t it really the sun’s choice for whom he chooses to exist?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ said Sati, looking at Shiva, melancholic. ‘The moment he became the sun, his calling \\nbecame higher. He does not exist for himself. He exists for the greater good of everyone. His \\nluminosity is the lifeblood of the solar system. And if the earth has any sense of responsibility, \\nshe will not do anything to destroy this balance.’ \\n\\n‘So what should the sun do?’asked Shiva, his hurt and anger showing on his face. ‘Just waste his \\nentire life burning away ? Looking at the earth from a distance?’ \\n\\n‘The earth isn’t going away anywhere. The sun and the earth can still share a warm friendship. \\nBut anything more is against the laws. It is against the interests of others.’ \\n\\nShiva turned away from Sati in anger. He looted north to seek solace from his holy late. \\nFeeling nothing, he looted up at the skies, towards the gods he did not believe in. \\n\\nDammit! \\n\\nHe banged the balcony railing with his powerful fist, dislodging some bricks and stormed off. \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\nOutside the city walls, in a forested area, a few soldiers lay in wait. At a slight distance, two \\nhooded figures were seated on large rocks. The captain of the platoon of soldiers stood rigid in \\nattention next to the duo. He could not believe that he was standing next to the Queen herself. The \\nprivilege overwhelmed him. \\n\\nOne of the hooded figures raised his hand to motion for the captain to step closer. On the \\nhooded figure’s wrist was a leather bracelet with the serpent Aum. ‘Vishwadyumna, are you sure \\nthis is where we are supposed to meet him? He is late by nearly an hour.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’replied Vishwadyumna nervously. ‘This is exactly where he had said he \\nwould come.’ \\n\\nThe other hooded figure turned and spoke in a commanding voice - a feminine one. A voice \\nused to being obeyed without question. ‘That man makes the Queen of the Nagas wait! ’ Turning to \\nthe other hooded figure, she continued, ‘I trust you have worked this out in detail. I hope I haven’t \\nentered this vile territory in vain.’ \\n\\nThe other hooded figure moved his fleshy hands in a motion asking the Queen for patience. \\n‘Have faith, your Highness. This man is our key to giving the Suryavanshis a blow that they will \\nnever recover from.’ \\n\\n‘Apparently, there was an Agnipariksha fight between the princess and a man in the city \\nyesterday,’said Vishwadyumna suddenly, trying to impress the Queen with his sharp ear for \\nlocal knowledge. ‘I do not have the exact details. I j ust hope that our man was not involved in it.’ \\n\\nThe Queen turned swiftly to the other hooded figure. Then back to Vishwadyumna. ‘Please \\nwait with the other soldiers.’ \\n\\nVishwadyumna sensed he had said something he shouldn’t have and quickly retreated before \\nhis Lord’s stern gaze could reprimand him. This is why he had been told in training school that a \\ngood soldier never speaks unless spoken to. \\n\\n‘ She\\'s here?’ asked the Queen with barely suppressed anger. \\n\\nThe other hooded figure nodded. \\n\\n‘I thought I’d told you to forget about this,’said the Queen sternly. There is nothing to be gained \\nby this quest. Do you realise that your stupid attack on Mount Mandar may have let them suspect \\nthat we have a mole in their midst?’ \\n\\nThe male figure looted up in apology. \\n\\n‘Did you come here for her?’ \\n\\n‘No, your Highness,’said the hooded figure with a deeply respectful tone. This was the place \\nwhere he asked us to meet him.’ \\n\\nThe Queen reached her hand out and gently patted the man’s shoulder. ‘Stay focussed, my \\nchild,’said the Queen softly. ‘If we pull this off, it will be our biggest victory ever. Lite you just \\nsaid, we will strike a blow that they will find very difficult to recover from.’ \\n\\nThe man nodded. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘And yet,’continued the Queen, pulling her hand back into the shelter of her blackrobes, ‘your \\npreoccupation with her, mates you take uncharacteristic decisions. Do you know he has sent a \\nclear message that she cannot be touched? Otherwise, the deal is off.’ \\n\\nThe hooded figure stared at the Queen in surprise. ‘How did you...’ \\n\\n‘I am the Queen of the Nagas, my child,’she interrupted. ‘I have more than one piece on the \\nchessboard.’ \\n\\nThe hooded figure continued to look at the Queen, ashamed about his poor call at Mount \\nMandar. The Queen’s next words added to his shame. ‘You are making surprising mistakes, my \\nchild. You have the potential to be the greatest Naga ever. Don’t waste it.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, your Highness.’ \\n\\nThe Queen appeared to relax. \\n\\n‘I thinkwhen we are alone now,’said the Queen, ‘maybe you can refer to me as Mausi. After \\nall I am your mother\\'s sister\\' \\n\\n‘Of course, you are,’said the hooded figure as a smile reached his eyes. ‘Whatever you say, \\nmausi.’ \\n\\n\\n— AflDlT^ — \\n\\nIt had been two weeks since the Agnipariksha. Sati had recovered sufficiently for the convoy to \\ncontinue its journey to its next destination. Shiva, Parvateshwar and Brahaspati sat together in \\nShiva’s chambers at the guest-house. \\n\\n‘It’s agreed then,’said Parvateshwar. ‘I will mate the arrangements for us to commence our \\njourney a weekfrom today. By that time, Sati should have recovered completely’ \\n\\n‘Yes, I think that is a suitable plan,’ agreed Shiva. \\n\\n‘Parvateshwar, I will not be coming along any further,’ said Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘Why?’ asked Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Well, the new chemicals I had ordered have come. I was considering going back with the \\nconsignment to Mount Mandar so that the experiments can begin as soon as possible. If we can \\nget this right, the consumption of water for making the Somras will reduce drastically.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled sadly. ‘I am going to miss you my friend.’ \\n\\n‘And I you,’said Brahaspati. ‘But I am not leaving the country. When you finish your tour, \\ncome to Mount Mandar. I’ll show you around the sylvan forests near our facility ’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Shiva with a grin. ‘Perhaps you will reveal some of your scientific skills and \\ndiscover a plausible cause for the blue throat!’ \\n\\nBoth Shiva and Brahaspati burst out laughing. Parvateshwar, who did not understand the private \\njoke, looted on politely. \\n\\n‘Just one point, Brahaspati,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘I will not be able to divert any soldiers from the \\nroyal entourage. I will speak with Governor Jhooleshwar to send some soldiers along for your \\nreturn journey.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Thankyou, Parvateshwar. But I am sure I will be fine. Why should a terrorist be interested in \\nme?’ \\n\\n‘There was another terrorist attack yesterday in a village some fifty kilometres from Mohan Jo \\nDaro,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘The entire temple was destroyed and all the Brahmins killed.’ \\n\\n‘Another one,’ said Shiva, angered. ‘That is the third attackthis month! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘They are getting bolder. And as usual, they escaped before any \\nback-up could arrive to give them a real fight’ \\n\\nShiva clenched his fists. He had no idea on how to counter the terror attacks. There was no way \\nto prepare for them since nobody knew where they would strike next. Was attacking Swadweep, \\nthe Chandravanshi’s own country, the only way to stop this? Brahaspati kept quiet, sensing Shiva’s \\ninner turmoil. He knew there were no easy answers. \\n\\nLooking at Shiva, Parvateshwar continued, ‘I will also get my people to make preparations for \\nour journey. I’ll meet you in the evening for dinner. I think Sati can finally join us. I will send \\ninstructions for Nandi and Veerbhadra to join us. I know you like their company.’ \\n\\nShiva looked starled at Parvateshwar’s uncharacteristic thoughtfulness. ‘Thank you \\nParvateshwar. This is very kind of you. But I believe Krittika, Nandi and Veerbhadra are going to \\na flute recital tonight. That crazy Veerbhadra has even bought some jewels so that he won’t look \\nlike a country bumpkin next to Nandi!’ \\n\\nParvateshwar smiled politely. \\n\\n‘But it will be a pleasure to dine with you,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘Thankyou,’said Parvateshwar as he got up. After a few steps, he stopped and turned around. \\nOvercoming his hesitation, he mumbled. ‘Shiva! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes?’ Shiva got up. \\n\\n‘I don’t think I ever told you this,’said Parvateshwar, uncomfortable. ‘But I would like to thank \\nyou for helping Sati in her agnipariksha. It was your clear thinking which led to victory ’ \\n\\n‘No, no,’ said Shiva. ‘It was her brilliance.’ \\n\\n‘Of course it was,’said Parvateshwar. ‘But you gave her the confidence and the strategy to \\nshow her brilliance. If there is any person in the world that I lookat with a feeling beyond a sense \\nof duty, it is Sati. I thankyou for helping her.’ \\n\\n‘You are welcome,’ smiled Shiva, with sense not to embarrass Parvateshwar further by \\nlengthening this conversation. \\n\\nParvateshwar smiled and folded his hands into a namaste. While he had still not fallen prey to \\nthe country-wide ‘Neelkanth fever’, he was beginning to respect Shiva. Earning Parvateshwar’s \\nesteem was a long journey that Shiva had only just begun. The General turned around and \\nwalked out of the room. \\n\\n‘He is not a bad sort,’said Brahaspati, looking at Parvateshwar’s retreating back ‘He may be a \\nlittle surly. But he is one of the most honest Suryavanshis I have ever met. A true follower of \\nLord Ram. I hope you don’t get too upset by the ill-tempered things he says to you.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t,’said Shiva. ‘In fact, I think very highly of Parvateshwar. He is one man whose respect \\nI would certainly like to earn.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled seeing yet another instance of Shiva’s large heart. He leaned closer and said, \\n‘You are a good man.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled back \\n\\n\\n\\n‘I had not answered you the last time you had asked me, Shiva,’ continued Brahaspati. \\n‘Honestly, I have never believed in the legend of the Neelkanth. I still don’t.’ \\n\\nShiva’s smile became a little broader. \\n\\n‘But I believe in you. If there is one person capable of sucking the negative energy out of this \\nland, I think it will be you. And I will do all I can to help you. In whatever way I can.’ \\n\\n‘You are the brother I never had Brahaspati. Just your presence is all the help I need.’ \\n\\nSaying so Shiva embraced his friend. Brahaspati hugged Shiva backwarmly, feeling a sense of \\nrenewed energy course through him. He swore once again that he would never backoff from his \\nmission. No matter what. It wasn’t just for Meluha. It was also for Shiva. His friend. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt was over three weeks after Sati’s agnipariksha that the convoy set off from Karachapa. The \\nusual seven carriages travelled in a row. This time not five, but six carriages were dummies. \\nShiva sat with Sati in the third and they had been joined by Parvateshwar and Ayurvati as well. It \\nwas the first time that Parvateshwar was travelling in the same carriage as Shiva. Krittika had \\nbegged off the carriage and volunteered to ride, claiming that she was missing the scenic beauty \\nof the countryside. Veerbhadra was more than pleased to ride along with her in Nandi’s platoon. \\n\\nThey had journeyed just a few days away from Karachapa when the convoy was brought to \\na halt by a large caravan travelling hurriedly in the opposite direction. Parvateshwar stepped out \\nof the carriage to inquire. Brigadier Vraka came up to Parvateshwar and executed a military \\nsalute. \\n\\n‘What is the matter?’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, they are refugees from the village of Koonj,’said Vraka. ‘They are escaping a \\nterrorist attack.’ \\n\\n‘Escaping! ’ asked a surprised Parvateshwar. ‘You mean the attack is still on?’ \\n\\n‘I think so, my Lord,’ said Vraka, his face filled with rage. \\n\\n‘Goddamit!’swore Parvateshwar. Neither Meluha nor he had ever got an opportunity like this. \\nTo be present at the right time and right place with a thousand five hundred soldiers while a \\nterrorist attack was in progress. And yet, Parvateshwar’s hands were tied. He was not allowed to \\ntake on any mission except to protect the Neelkanth and the Princess. \\n\\n‘What nonsense?’he thought to himself. ‘My orders forbid me from following my Kshatriya \\ndharma!’ \\n\\n‘What’s the matter, Parvateshwar?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar turned to find Shiva right behind him. Sati and Ayurvati were getting out of the \\ncarriage as well. Before Parvateshwar could answer, a horrible noise tore through the quiet forest \\nroad. It was a sound Shiva had come to recognise. It declared the evil intentions of the conch-shell \\nbearer, loud and clear. It announced that an attack had begun. A Naga attack had begun! \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17 \\n\\n\\nThe Battle ofKoonj \\n\\n‘Where are they?’ asked Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘They are in my village, my Lord,’said the scared village headman. ‘It’s a short distance from \\nhere. Some five hundred Chandravanshi soldiers, led by five Nagas. They gave us thirty minutes \\nto leave. But the Brahmins at the temple were detained.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar clenched his fists to regain his control despite his fury. \\n\\n‘Our Panditji is a good man, my Lord,’said the village headman. Tears spilled out of his eyes. \\nVraka put a comforting hand on the headman’s shoulder. But the gesture only made the headman \\nmore miserable. Not knowing the fate of the village priest added to his guilt. \\n\\n‘We wanted to stay and fight alongside our Pandit and the other Brahmins,’ sobbed the \\nheadman. ‘They are men of god. They don’t even know how to raise a weapon. How can they \\nfight against this horde?’ \\n\\nVraka let go off the headman as anger got the better of him. \\n\\n‘But Panditji ordered us to leave. He told us to flee with our women and children. He said he \\nwould face whatever Lord Brahma has written in his fate. But if anyone can be saved, they \\nshould be.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar’s nails dug into his skin. He was livid at the cowardly Chandravanshis for yet \\nagain attacking defenceless Brahmins and not Kshatriyas who could retaliate. He was incensed at \\nhis fate for having put him in a position where he could not take action. A part of him wanted to \\nignore his orders. But he was bound not to break the law. \\n\\n‘THIS NONSENSE HAS TO STOP! ’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted up to see which voice had echoed his thoughts. The expression on Shiva’s \\nface almost threw him back for a moment. The intense fury visible in the Neelkanth would have \\nbrought even a Deva to a standstill. \\n\\n‘We are good people,’raged Shiva. ‘We are not scared chicken who should turn and flee! \\nThose terrorists should be on the run. They should be the ones feeling the wrath of the \\nSuryavanshis!’ \\n\\nA villager standing behind the headman said, ‘But they are terrorists! We cannot defeat them. \\nThe Panditj i knew that. That is why he ordered us to run.’ \\n\\n‘But we have a thousand five hundred soldiers,’ said Shiva, irritated at the display of such \\ncowardice. ‘And another five hundred of you. We outnumber them four to one. We can crush \\nthem. Teach them a lesson they will remember.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nThe headman argued. ‘But they have Nagas! They are supernatural, blood-thirsty killers! What \\nchance do we have against such evil?’ \\n\\nShiva had the presence of mind to realise that superstition can only be countered by another \\nstronger belief. He climbed the carriage pedestal to stand tall. The villagers stared at him. He \\nripped off his cravat and threw it away. He didn’t need it anymore. \\n\\n‘I am the Neelkanth! ’ \\n\\nAll the soldiers looted up at the destroyer of evil mesmerised. They were overjoyed to see \\nhim truly accept his destiny. The villagers who did not know of the Neelkanth’s arrival were \\nstunned at seeing the legend come alive right before their eyes. \\n\\n‘I am going to fight these terrorists,’roared Shiva. ‘I am going to show them that we are not \\nscared anymore. I am going to mate them feel the pain we feel. I am going to let them know that \\nMeluha is not going to roll over and let them do what they want.’ \\n\\nPure energy coursed through the huddled mass that stood in front of Shiva, straightening their \\nspines and inspiring their souls. \\n\\n‘Who’s coming with me?’ \\n\\n‘I am,’bellowed Parvateshwar, feeling the suffocating restraints imposed on him fall away by \\nShiva’s pronouncement. \\n\\n‘I am,’ echoed Sati, Nandi, Veerbhadra and Vraka. \\n\\n‘I am,’ echoed every single soul standing there. \\n\\nSuddenly the scared villagers and soldiers were turned into a righteous army. The soldiers \\ndrew their swords. The villagers grabbed whatever weapons they could from the travelling \\narmoury. \\n\\n‘To Koonj,’ yelled Shiva, mounting a horse and galloping ahead. \\n\\nParvateshwar and Sati quickly unharnessed the horses from the cart and raced behind Shiva. \\nThe Suryavanshis charged behind them, letting out a cry louder than any Naga conch shell. As \\nthey stormed into Koonj, the horror of what had transpired hit them. The Chandravanshis had \\nignored the rest of the village and concentrated on the area that would distress the Meluhans most \\n- their venerated temple. Decapitated bodies of the Brahmins lay around the shrine. They had \\nbeen clumped together and executed. The temple itself was ruthlessly destroyed and aflame. The \\nsight of the gruesome attack enraged the Suryavanshis even more. They charged like crazed \\nbulls. The Chandravanshis had no chance. They were completely outnumbered and \\noverwhelmed. They lost ground quickly. Some of the Chandravanshis were beginning to retreat \\nwhen the five Nagas rallied them back. They fought on against the crushing odds, clashing against \\nthe righteous Suryavanshis with unexpected courage. \\n\\nParvateshwar fought like a man possessed. Shiva, who had never seen the General battle, was \\nawed by his skill and valour. Lite Shiva, Parvateshwar knew that the key to victory were the \\nNagas. As long as they were alive, the Suryavanshis would feel terrified and the Chandravanshis \\nwould draw inspiration from them. He attacked one of them with frenzied aggression. \\n\\nThe Naga skilfully parried Parvateshwar’s attack with his shield. Bringing his sword down, he \\ntried to strike Parvateshwar’s exposed shoulder. What he didn’t know was that Parvateshwar had \\ndeliberately left his flank exposed. Swinging to the side to avoid the blow, Parvateshwar let his \\nshield clap to his back as he swiftly drew a knife held in a clip behind. He hurled it at the Naga’s \\nexposed right shoulder. His cry let Parvateshwar know that the knife had penetrated deep. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Naga roared in fury. But to Parvateshwar’s surprised admiration, he swung his sword arm, \\nwith the knife buried in his shoulder, back into the batde. Parvateshwar brought his shield backup \\nand blocked the slightly weaker strike from the Naga. He brought his sword up in a stab but the \\nNaga was too quick and deflected it. Swerving left, Parvateshwar rammed his shield down hard \\non the knife still buried in the Naga’s shoulder. The knife chipped through the shoulder bone. The \\nNaga snarled in pain and stumbled. That was the opening that Parvateshwar needed. Bringing his \\nsword up in a brutal upward stab, he pushed it ruthlessly through the Naga’s heart. The Naga froze \\nas Parvateshwar’s sword ripped the life out of him. Parvateshwar pushed his sword in deeper, \\ncompleting the kill. The Naga fell back motionless. \\n\\nParvateshwar was not above the Meluhan fascination with a Naga face. He kneeled to tear the \\nNaga’s mask off to reveal a horrifying countenance. The Naga’s nose was pure bone and had \\ngrown to almost form a bird-like beak His ears were ridiculously large while his mouth was \\ngrotesquely constricted. He looked like a vulture in human form. Parvateshwar quickly whispered \\nwhat every Suryavanshi said when he brought down a worthy opponent, ‘Have a safe journey to \\nthe other side, brave warrior.’ \\n\\nOne down four to go, thought Parvateshwar rising. Correction, two down, three to go. He saw \\nShiva bring down a gigantic Naga in the distance. Both Shiva and Parvateshwar saw each other \\nand nodded. Shiva pointed towards Parvateshwar’s back Parvateshwar turned to see a ferocious \\nNaga fighting five Suryavanshis singlehandedly. He turned back to look at Shiva and nodded. \\nShiva turned to charge at another Naga as Parvateshwar turned to the one marked for him. \\n\\nShiva dashed through the pitched battle scene towards the Naga who had just killed a \\nSuryavanshi soldier. He leapt high as he ran in close, with his shield in front to prevent the \\nstandard swinging strike from the Naga. The Naga had brought his own shield up to prevent what \\nhe expected from Shiva — the orthodox up to down swinging strike from a good height. Shiva, \\nhowever, surprised the Naga by thrusting in his sword sideward, neatly circumventing the Naga’s \\nshield and gashing his arm. The Naga bellowed in pain and fell back He straightened and held his \\nshield high again, realising that Shiva was going to be a much more formidably enemy than the \\nprevious Sury avanshi. \\n\\nAs Shiva grimly fought the fearless Naga, he did not notice another one at a distance. This \\nNaga could see that their assault was being progressively pushed back It was a matter of time \\nbefore the Nagas and the Chandravanshis would have to retreat. This Naga would have to face \\nthe ignominy of having led the first failed attack And he could see that it was Shiva who had led \\nthe counter-offensive. That man had to be destroyed for the future of the mission. The Naga \\ndrew his bow forward. \\n\\nShiva meanwhile, unaware of the danger, had wedged his sword a little into the Naga’s \\nstomach. The Naga grimly fought on, stepping back slowly while ramming Shiva with his shield. \\nHe tried in vain to swing his sword down to slice Shiva, who kept his own shield at the ready. He \\nkept fending the Naga’s blows while pressing ahead, pushing the sword in deeper and deeper. It \\nwas a few more seconds before the Naga’s soul gave up. It slipped away as his body bled to \\ndeath and collapsed. Shiva looted down at the fallen Naga in awe. \\n\\nThese people maybe evil, but they are fearless soldiers. \\n\\nShiva looted to the left to find that Parvateshwar too had killed the Naga he had engaged. He \\ncontinued to turn slowly, trying to find the last Naga. Then he heard a loud shout from the person \\n\\n\\n\\nhe had come to love beyond reason. \\n\\n‘S-H-I-V-A.’ \\n\\nShiva turned to his right to find Sati racing towards him. He looted behind her to see if anyone \\nwas chasing her. There was nobody. He frowned. Before he could react, Sati leapt forward. A \\njump timed to perfection. \\n\\nThe Naga at the distance had released the agnibaan or the fire arrow , one of the legendary \\npoisoned arrows of their people. The venom on its tip burned its victim’s body from the inside, \\ncausing a slow, painful death that would scar the soul for many births. The arrow had been set \\nstraight at Shiva’s neck. It sped unerringly on its deadly mission. However, the Naga had not \\ncalculated the possibility of someone obstructing its path. \\n\\nSati twisted her body in mid-air as she leapt in front of Shiva. The arrow slammed into her \\nchest with brutal force, propelling her airborne body backward. She fell to Shiva’s left, limp and \\nmotionless. A stunned Shiva stared at Sati’s prone body, his heart shattering. \\n\\nThe destroyer of evil roared in fury. He charged at the Naga like a wild elephant on the brink \\nof insanity, his sword raised. The Naga was momentarily staggered by the fearsome sight of the \\ncharging Neelkanth. But to his credit, he rallied. He swiftly drew another arrow from his quiver, \\nloaded it and let it fly. Shiva swung his sword to deflect the arrow, barely missing a step or \\ndecreasing his manic speed. The increasingly panic struck Naga loaded another arrow and shot \\nagain. Shiva swung his sword once more, deflecting the arrow easily, picking up more speed. The \\nNaga reached backto draw another arrow. But it was too late. With a fierce yell, Shiva leapt high \\nas he neared the Naga. He swung his sword viciously, decapitating the Naga with one swing of his \\nsword. The Naga’s lifeless body fell in a heap as his severed head flew with the mighty blow, \\nwhile his still pumping heart spewed blood through the gaping neck. \\n\\nThe Neelkanth’s vengeance was not quenched. Screaming, Shiva bent and kept hacking at the \\nNaga’s inert body, ruthlessly slashing it to bits. No assertion of reason, no articulation of sanity \\ncould have penetrated Shiva’s enraged mind. Except for a soft, muffled, injured voice that was \\nbarely audible in the din of battle, except to him. \\n\\n‘Shiva...’ \\n\\nHe turned backto lookat Sati lying in the distance, her head raised slightly. \\n\\n‘Sati!’ \\n\\nHe sped towards her, bellowing, ‘Parvateshwar! Get Ayurvati! Sati has fallen!’ \\n\\nAyurvati had already seen Sati’s injured body. The Chandravanshis were retreating in haste. \\nAyurvati ran towards Sati, as did Parvateshwar on hearing Shiva’s call. Shiva reached her first. \\nShe was motionless, but alive. She was breathing heavily as the arrow had pierced her left lung, \\nflooding her innards with her blood. She couldn’t speak as the force of the blow had made the \\nblood gush from her mouth. But she continued to stare at Shiva. Her face had a strange smile, \\nalmost serene. She kept opening her mouth as if trying to say something. Shiva desperately \\nwanted to hold her, but he kept his hands locked together as he tried frantically to control his tears. \\n\\n‘O Lord Brahma!’cried Ayurvati as she reached Sati and recognised the arrow. ‘Mastrak! \\nDhruvini! Get a stretcher. Now!’ \\n\\nParvateshwar, Ayurvati, Mastrak and Dhruvini carried Sati to one of the village houses with \\nShiva following closely Ayurvati’s other assistants had already begun cleaning the hut and setting \\nthe instruments for the surgery. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Wait outside, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati to Shiva, raising her hand. \\n\\nShiva wanted to follow Ayurvati into the hut, but Parvateshwar held him back by touching his \\nshoulder. ‘Ayurvati is one of the best doctors in the world, Shiva. Let her do her job.’ \\n\\nShiva turned to look at Parvateshwar, who was doing an admirable job of controlling his \\nemotions. But it took one look in his eyes for Shiva to know that Parvateshwar was as afraid for \\nSati as he was. Probably more than he had been before Sati’s agnipariksha. Suddenly a thought hit \\nShiva. He turned and hurried to the closest Naga body. Bending quickly, he checked the right \\nwrist. Finding nothing there, he turned and rushed to the other Naga dead body. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Parvateshwar had rallied his disturbed mind enough to realise the important tasks \\nthat needed to be done. He called Vraka and ordered, ‘Place guards over the prisoners of war. \\nGet doctors to attend to all the injured, including the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘The injured Chandravanshis have already taken their poison, my Lord,’said Vraka. ‘You know \\nthey will never want to be caught alive.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted at Vraka with a withering look, clearly saying that he wasn’t interested in \\nthe details and Vraka should get to the task at hand. \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Vraka, acknowledging Parvateshwar’s silent order. \\n\\n‘Arrange a perimeter for any counter-attack,’ continued Parvateshwar, his consciousness \\nalready drawn backto Sati’s condition in the house behind him. ‘And...’ \\n\\nVraka looted up at Parvateshwar, surprised by his Lord’s hesitation. He had never seen his \\nLord hesitate before. But Vraka had the good sense to not say anything. He waited for his Lord to \\ncomplete his statement. \\n\\n‘And...’ continued Parvateshwar. ‘There should be some courier-pigeons still alive in the \\ntemple. Send a red coloured letter to Devagiri. To the Emperor. Tell him Princess Sati is seriously \\ninjured.’ \\n\\nVraka looted up in disbelief. He had no news about Sati. But wisely, he did not say anything. \\n\\n‘Tell the Emperor,’ continued Parvateshwar, ‘that she has been shot by an agnibaan.’ \\n\\n‘O Lord Indra!’blurted Vraka unable to control his shocked dismay. \\n\\n‘Do it now, Brigadier! ’ snarled Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Vraka with a weaksalute. \\n\\nShiva meanwhile had already checked the wrists of four of the Nagas. None of them wore the \\nleather bracelet with the serpent aum that Shiva had come to recognise. He reached the last one. \\nThe one who had shot Sati. The wretched one who Shiva had hacked. Shiva kicked the Naga’s \\ntorso with intense hatred before trying to find his right arm. It took him some time to find the \\nsevered limb. Locating it, he raised the remnants of the robe to check the wrist. There was no \\nleather bracelet. It wasn’t him. \\n\\nShiva came backto the hut to find Parvateshwar seated on a stool outside. Krittika was standing \\nbeside the hut entrance, sobbing uncontrollably. Veerbhadra was holding her gently comforting \\nher. A distraught Nandi stood at Veerbhadra’s side, his face stunned into a blank expression. \\nParvateshwar looted up at Shiva and pointed to the empty stool next to him with a weak smile. He \\nwas making brave attempts to appear under control. Shiva sat down slowly and looted into the \\ndistance, waiting for Ayurvati to come out. \\n\\n\\n\\n— Aom — \\n\\n‘We have removed the arrow, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati. \\n\\nShiva and Parvateshwar were standing in the hut, looking at an unconscious Sati. Nobody else \\nwas allowed in. Ayurvati had clearly said that Sati did not need the risk of increased infection. \\nAnd nobody dared argue with the formidable Ayurvati on medical matters. Mastrakand Dhruvini \\nhad already fanned out to support the other medical officers treating the injured Suryavanshi \\nsoldiers. \\n\\nShiva turned to the right of the bed to see the bloodied tong that had been used to stretch Sati’s \\ninnards to pull the arrow out. That tong would never be used again. It had been infected with the \\nagnibaan poison. No amount of heat or chemicals would mate the instrument sterile and safe \\nagain. Next to the tong lay the offending arrow, wrapped in neem leaves, where it would stay for \\none full day, before being buried deep in a dry grave to ensure it would not cause any more \\nharm. \\n\\nShiva looted at Ayurvati, his eyes moist, unable to find the strength to ask the question that \\nraged in his heart. \\n\\n‘I will not lie to you, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati, in the detached manner that doctors will \\nthemselves into, to find the strength in traumatic circumstances. ‘It doesn’t look good. Nobody in \\nhistory has survived an agnibaan which has penetrated one of the vital organs. The poison will \\nstart causing an intense fever in some time, which will result in the failing of one organ after \\nanother.’ \\n\\nShiva looted down at Sati and then up pleadingly. Ayurvati fought hard to rein in her tears and \\nkeep her composure. She couldn’t afford to lose control. She had many lives to save in the next \\nfew hours. \\n\\n‘I am sorry, my Lord,’said Ayurvati. ‘But there really is no cure. We can only give some \\nmedicines to mate her end easier.’ \\n\\nShiva glared angrily at Ayurvati. ‘We are not giving up! Is that clear?’ \\n\\nAyurvati looted at the ground, unable to meet Shiva’s eye. \\n\\n‘If the fever is kept under control, then her organs will not be damaged, right?’asked Shiva, as a \\nglimmer of hope entered his being. \\n\\nAyurvati looted up and said, ‘Yes, my Lord. But that is not a final solution. The fever caused \\nby an agnibaan can only be delayed, not broken. If we try and control the fever, it will come \\nbackeven stronger once the medicines are stopped.’ \\n\\n‘Then we will control the fever forever!’cried Shiva. ‘I will sit by her side all my life if \\nneeded. The fever will not rise.’ \\n\\nAyurvati was about to say something to Shiva, but thought better of it and kept silent. She would \\ncome back to Shiva in a few hours. She knew that Sati could not be saved. It was impossible. \\nPrecious time was being wasted in this futile discussion. Time that could be used to save other \\nlives. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Alright, my Lord,’said Ayurvati, quickly administering the medicines to Sati to keep her fever \\ndown. ‘This should keep her fever down for a few hours.’ \\n\\nShe looked up at Parvateshwar standing at the back for an instant. Parvateshwar knew that \\nkeeping the fever down would only lengthen Sati’s agony. But he too felt the glimmer of hope that \\nShiva felt. \\n\\nTurning backtowards Shiva, Ayurvati said, ‘My Lord, you too are injured. Let me dress your \\nwounds and I’ll leave.’ \\n\\n‘I am alright,’ said Shiva, not taking his eyes off Sati for an instant. \\n\\n‘No, you are not, my Lord,’said Ayurvati firmly. ‘Your wounds are deep. If they catch an \\ninfection, then it could be life threatening.’ \\n\\nShiva did not answer. He j ust kept looking at Sati and waved his hand dismissively. \\n\\n‘Shiva! ’ shouted Ayurvati. Shiva looked up at her. ‘You cannot help Sati if you yourself become \\nunwell!’ \\n\\nThe harsh tone had the desired effect. While Shiva did not move from his place, he let \\nAyurvati dress his wounds. Ayurvati then quickly tended to Parvateshwar’s wounds and left the \\nhut. \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\nShiva looted at the prahar lamp in the hut. It had been three hours since Ayurvati had removed \\nthe arrow. Parvateshwar had left the hut to look after the other injured and mate the preparations \\nfor setting up camp, since the convoy was going to stay in Koonj for some time. That was \\nParvateshwar’s way. If he was confronted with an ugly situation that he could do nothing about, \\nhe did not wallow in his misery. He would drown himself in his work so that he did not have to \\nthinkabout the crisis. \\n\\nShiva was different. Many years back, he had sworn that he would never run from a difficult \\nsituation. Even if there was absolutely nothing he could do. He hadn’t left Sati’s side for a \\nmoment. He sat patiently by her bed, waiting for her to recover. Hoping for her to recover. \\nPraying for her to recover. \\n\\n‘Shiva...’ a barely audible whisper broke the silence. \\n\\nShiva looted at Sati’s face. Her eyes were slightly open. Her hand had moved indiscernibly. \\nHe pulled his chair closer, careful not to touch her. \\n\\n‘I’m so sorry,’ cried Shiva. ‘I should never have got us into this fight.’ \\n\\n‘No, no,’murmured Sati. ‘You did the right thing. Someone had to mate our stand. You have \\ncome to Meluha to lead us and to destroy evil. You did your duty.’ \\n\\nShiva continued to stare at Sati, overcome by grief. Sati widened her eyes a bit, she was trying \\nto take in as much of Shiva as she could, in what she knew were her last moments. Death is the \\nultimate destroyer of a soul’s aspirations. Ironically, it is usually the approach of this very \\ndestruction which gives a soul the courage to challenge every constraint and express itself. \\n\\n\\n\\nExpress even a long-denied dream. \\n\\n‘It is my time to go, Shiva,’whispered Sati. ‘But before I go, I want to tell you that the last few \\nmonths have been the happiest in my life.’ \\n\\nShiva continued to look at Sati with moist eyes. His hands developed a life of their own and \\nmoved towards Sati. He checked himself in time. \\n\\n‘I wish you had come into my life earlier,’said Sati, letting out a secret that she hadn’t even \\nacknowledged to herself. ‘My life would have been so different.’ \\n\\nShiva’s eyes tried frantically to restrain themselves, struggling against the despair that needed \\nan outlet. \\n\\n‘I wish I had told you earlier,’murmured Sati. ‘Because the first time that I am telling you will \\nalso probably be the last.’ \\n\\nShiva looked on at her, his voice choked. \\n\\nSati looted deeply into Shiva’s eyes, whispering softly, ‘I love you.’ \\n\\nThe dam broke and tears poured down Shiva’s grief-stricken face. \\n\\n‘You are going to repeat these words for at least another hundred years,’sobbed Shiva. ‘You \\nare not going anywhere. I will fight the god of death himself, if I have to. You are not going \\nanywhere.’ \\n\\nSati smiled sadly and put her hand in Shiva’s. Her hand was burning. The fever had begun its \\nassault. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18 \\n\\n\\nSati and the Fire Arrow \\n\\n\\n‘Nothing can be done, my Lord,’ said a visibly uncomfortable Ayurvati. \\n\\nShe and Shiva were standing in a corner of the hut, at what they thought was a safe distance \\nbeyond the range of Sati’s ears. Parvateshwar was standing beside them, holding his tears back \\n\\n‘Come on, Ayurvati,’urged Shiva. ‘You are the best doctor in the land. All we have to do is \\nbreak the fever.’ \\n\\n‘This fever cannot be broken,’ reasoned Ayurvati. ‘There is no cure for the agnibaan poison. \\nWe are only lengthening Sati’s agony by keeping the fever low. The moment the medicines are \\nstopped, the fever will recur with a vengeance.’ \\n\\n‘Let it go, Shiva,’mumbled a frail voice from the bed. Everyone turned to stare at Sati. Her \\nface bore a smile that comes only with the acceptance of the inevitable. ‘I have no regrets. I have \\ntold you what I needed to. I am content. My time has come.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t give up on me, Sati,’cried Shiva. ‘You are not gone yet. We will find a way. I will find a \\nway. Just bear with me.’ \\n\\nSati gave up. She didn’t have the strength. She also knew that Shiva had to find his own peace \\nwith her death. And he wouldn’t find that unless he felt he had tried everything possible to save \\nher. \\n\\n‘I can feel my fever rising,’ said Sati. ‘Please give me the medicines.’ \\n\\nAyurvati glanced at Sati uncomfortably. All her medical training told her that she shouldn’t do \\nthis. She knew that she was just increasing Sati’s suffering by giving her medicines. Sati stared \\nhard at Ayurvati. She couldn’t give up now. Not when Shiva had asked her to hang on. \\n\\n‘Give me the medicines, Ayurvatiji,’ repeated Sati. ‘I know what I am doing.’ \\n\\nAyurvati gave Sati the medicines. She gazed into Sati’s eyes, expecting to find some traces of \\nfear or anguish. There were none. Ayurvati smiled gently and walked back to Shiva and \\nParvateshwar. \\n\\n‘I know! ’ exclaimed Shiva. ‘Why don’t we give her the Somras?’ \\n\\n‘What effect will that have, my Lord?’asked a surprised Ayurvati. ‘The Somras only works on \\nthe oxidants and increases a person’s lifespan. It doesn’t work on inj uries.’ \\n\\n‘Look Ayurvati, I don’t think anyone truly understands everything about the Somras. I know \\nyou know that. What you don’t know is that the Somras repaired a frostbitten toe that I had lived \\nwith all my life. It also repaired my dislocated shoulder.’ \\n\\n‘What!’said a visibly surprised Parvateshwar. ‘That’s impossible. The Somras does not cure \\n\\n\\n\\nphysical disabilities.’ \\n\\n‘It did in my case.’ \\n\\n‘But that could also be because you are special, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati. ‘You are the \\nNeelkanth.’ \\n\\n‘I didn’t drop from the sky, Ayurvati. My body is as human as Sati’s. As human as yours. Let’s \\njust try it!’ \\n\\nParvateshwar did not need any more convincing. He dashed out to find Vraka sitting on a stool. \\nVraka immediately rose and saluted his commander. \\n\\n‘Vraka,’said Parvateshwar. ‘The temple could still have some Somras powder. It was the main \\nproduction centre of the area. I want that powder. Now’ \\n\\n‘You will have it in ten minutes, my Lord,’ boomed Vraka as he rushed off with his guards. \\n\\n— xmw - \\n\\n‘There is nothing else to do but wait,’said Ayurvati as Sati fell asleep. The Somras had been \\nadministered — a stronger dose than usual. ‘Parvateshwar, you are tired. You need to recover \\nfrom your wounds. Please go and sleep.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t need sleep,’said Parvateshwar stubbornly. ‘I am staying on guard with my soldiers at \\nthe perimeter. You can’t trust those Chandravanshis. They may launch a counterattack at night.’ \\n\\nA frustrated Ayurvati glared at Parvateshwar, her belief reinforced that the machismo of the \\nKshatriyas made them impossible patients. \\n\\n‘Are you going to bed, my Lord?’asked Ayurvati, turning towards Shiva, hoping that at least he \\nwould listen. ‘There is nothing you can do now. We just have to wait. And you need the rest.’ \\n\\nShiva just shook his head. Wild horses could not drag him away from Sati. \\n\\n‘We could arrange a bed in this hut,’continued Ayurvati. ‘You could sleep here if you wish so \\nthat you can keep an eye on Sati.’ \\n\\n‘Thankyou, but I am not going to sleep,’said Shiva, briefly looking at Ayurvati before turning \\ntowards Sati. ‘I am staying here. You go to sleep. I will call you if there is any change.’ \\n\\nAyurvati glared at Shiva and then whispered, ‘As you wish, my Lord.’ \\n\\nA tired Ayurvati walked towards her own hut. She needed to get some rest since the next day \\nwould be busy. She would have to check the wounds of all the injured to ensure that recovery was \\nproceeding properly. The first twenty-four hours were crucial. Her medical corps had been \\nbroken into groups to keep a staggered, all-night vigil for any emergencies. \\n\\n‘I will be with the soldiers, Shiva,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘Nandi and Veerbhadra are on duty \\noutside along with some of my personal guards.’ \\n\\nShiva knew what Parvateshwar actually wanted to say. \\n\\n‘I will call you as soon as there is a change, Parvateshwar,’ said Shiva, looking up at the \\nGeneral. \\n\\nParvateshwar smiled weakly and nodded to Shiva. He rushed out before his feelings could \\n\\n\\n\\ncause him any embarrassment. \\n\\n\\n- xmw - \\n\\n\\nParvateshwar sat silently, his soldiers at a respectful distance. They could tell when their Lord \\nwanted to be left alone. Parvateshwar was lost in thoughts of Sati. Why should a person like her be \\nput through so much suffering by the Almighty? He remembered her childhood. The day when \\nhe decided that here was a girl he would be proud to have as his goddaughter. \\n\\nThat fateful day, when for the first and only time, he regretted his vow to not have any \\nprogeny of his own. Which foolish father would not want a child like Sati? \\n\\nIt was a lazy afternoon more than a hundred years ago. Sati had just returned from the Gurukul \\nat the tender age of sixteen. Full of verve and a passionate belief in Lord Ram’s teachings. Lord \\nBrahmanayak still reigned over the land of Meluha. His son, Prince Daksha, was content being a \\nfamily man, spending his days with his wife and daughter. He showed absolutely no inclination to \\nmaster the warrior ways of the Kshatriya. Neither did he show the slightest ambition to succeed \\nhis father. \\n\\nOn that day, Daksha had settled down for a family picnic on the banks of the river Saraswati, a \\nshort distance from Devagiri. Parvateshwar remembered well his duties as the bodyguard to \\nDaksha then. He sat near the Prince, close enough to protect him, but far enough to give some \\nprivacy to the prince and his wife. Sati had wandered off into the forest further in the distance, \\nclose to the river so that she was visible. \\n\\nSuddenly Sati’s cry ripped through the silence. Daksha, Veerini and Parvateshwar looted up \\nstartled. They rushed to the edge of the bank to see Sati at the river bend, ferociously battling a \\npack of wild dogs. She was blocking them to protect a severely injured, fair woman. It could be \\nseen even from the distance that the caste-unmarked woman was a recent immigrant, who did \\nnot know that one never approached the banks without a sword to protect oneself from wild \\nanimals. She must have been attacked by the pack, which was large enough to bring down even a \\ncharging lion. \\n\\n‘Sati! ’ shouted Daksha in alarm. \\n\\nDrawing his sword, he charged down the river to protect his daughter. Parvateshwar followed \\nDaksha, his sword drawn for batde. Within moments, they had jumped into the fray. \\nParvateshwar charged aggressively into the pack, easily hacking many with quick strikes. Sati, \\nrejuvenated by the sudden support, fought back the four dogs charging her all at once. Daksha, \\ndespite an obvious lack of martial skills, fought ferociously, with the passionately protective spirit \\nthat comes only with being a parent. But the animals could sense that Daksha was the weakest \\namongst their human enemies. Six dogs charged at him at the same time. \\n\\nDaksha drove his sword forward in a brutal jab at the dog in front of him. A mistake. Even \\nthough Daksha felled the dog, his sword was stuck in the dead animal. That was all the opening \\nthat the other dogs needed. One charged viciously from the side, seizing Daksha’s right forearm in \\n\\n\\n\\nits jaws. Daksha roared in pain, but held on to his sword as he tried to wrestle his arm free. \\nAnother dog bit Daksha’s left leg, yanking some of his flesh out. Seeing his Lord in trouble, \\nParvateshwar yelled in fury as he swung his sword at the body of the dog clinging to Daksha’s \\narm, cleanly cutting the beast in half. Parvateshwar pirouetted around in the same smooth motion \\nslashing another dog charging Daksha from the front. Sati moved in to protect Daksha’s left flank \\nas Daksha angrily stabbed the dog clinging to his leg. Seeing their numbers rapidly depleting, the \\nremaining dogs retreated yelping. \\n\\n‘Daksha!’sobbed Veerini, as she rushed to hold up her collapsing husband. He was losing blood \\nat an alarming rate from his numerous wounds, especially the leg. The dog must have bitten \\nthrough a major artery. Parvateshwar quickly blew his distress conch shell. A cry for help \\nreached the scouts at the closest crossing-house. Soldiers and paramedics would be with them in a \\nfew minutes. Parvateshwar bound his angvastram tight around Daksha’s thigh to stem the \\nbleeding. Then he quickly helped the injured foreign woman move closer to the royal party. \\n\\n‘Father, are you alright?’ whispered Sati as she held her father’s hand. \\n\\n‘Dammit, Sati! ’ shouted Daksha. What do you thinkyou were doing?’ \\n\\nSati fell silent at the violent response from her doting father. \\n\\n‘Who asked you to be a hero?’harangued Daksha, fuming at his daughter. ‘What if something \\nhad happened to you? What would I do? Where would I go? And for whom were you risking your \\nlife? What difference does the life of that woman make?’ \\n\\nSati continued to look down, distraught at the scolding. She had been expecting praise. The \\ncrossing-house soldiers and paramedics rushed to the scene. With efficient movements, they \\nquickly stemmed the flow of Daksha’s blood. Dressing Parvateshwar’s and Sati’s minor wounds \\nrapidly, they carried Daksha on a stretcher. His wounds needed attention from the royal \\nphysician. \\n\\nAs Sati saw her father being carried away, she stayed rooted, deeply guilty at the harm her \\nactions had caused. She was only trying to save a woman in distress. Wasn’t it one of Lord Ram’s \\nprimary teachings that it is the duty of the strong to protect the weak? She felt a soft touch on her \\nshoulder. She turned to face Captain Parvateshwar, her father’s severe bodyguard. Strangely \\nthough, his face sported a rare smile. \\n\\n‘I am proud of you, my child,’whispered Parvateshwar. You are a true follower of Lord \\nRam.’ \\n\\nTears suddenly burst in Sati’s eyes. She looked away quickly. Taking time to control herself she \\nlooted up with a wan smile at the man she would grow to call Pitratuly a. She nodded softly. \\n\\nJolted back into the present by a bird call, Parvateshwar scanned the perimeter, his eyes moist \\nat the ancient memory. He clutched his hands in a prayer and whispered, ‘She’s your true \\nfollower, Lord Ram. Fight for her.’ \\n\\n— AGDIR® — \\n\\n\\n\\nShiva had lost track of time. Obviously, nobody had been assigned to reset the prahar lamps \\nwhen so many lives were still in danger. Looking out of the window, he could see early signs of \\ndawn. Shiva’s wounds burned, crying for relief. But he wasn’t going to give in. He sat quietly on \\nhis chair, next to Sati’s bed, restraining himself from making any noise that would disturb her. Sati \\nheld his hand tightly. Despite the searing heat of her feverish body, Shiva did not move his hands \\naway. His palms were sweaty due to the intense heat. \\n\\nHe looked longingly at Sati and softly whispered, ‘Either you stay here or I leave this world \\nwith you. The choice is yours.’ \\n\\nHe felt a slight twitch. He looted down to see Sati’s hand move slightly, allowing the sweat to \\nslide from between their entwined palms. It was almost impossible to say where the sweat came \\nfrom. \\n\\nIs it Sati’s or mine? \\n\\nShiva immediately reached out with his other hand towards Sati’s forehead. It was burning \\neven more strongly. But there were soft beads of perspiration on the temple. A burst of elation \\nshot through Shiva’s being. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘By the great Lord Brahma,’ whispered Ayurvati in awe. ‘I have never seen anything like this.’ \\n\\nShe was standing besides Sati’s bed. The still sleeping Sati was sweating profusely, her \\ngarments and bed soaked. Parvateshwar stood by her side, his face aglow with hope. \\n\\n‘The agnibaan fever never breaks,’ continued a stunned Ayurvati. ‘This is a miracle.’ \\n\\nShiva looted up, his face shimmering with the ecstasy of a soul that had salvaged its reason for \\nexistence. ‘May the Holy Late bless the Somras.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar noticed Sati’s hand clutched tightly in Shiva’s but he did not comment. The bliss \\nof this moment had finally crowded out his instinctive drive to stop something unacceptable under \\nthe laws of the land. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’said Ayurvati softly. ‘We must bathe her quickly. The sweat must be removed. \\nHowever, considering that her wounds cannot get wet, my nurses will have to rub her down.’ \\n\\nShiva looted up at Ayurvati and nodded, not understanding the implication. \\n\\n‘Umm, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati. ‘That means you will have to leave the room.’ \\n\\n‘Of course,’ said Shiva. \\n\\nAs he got up to leave, Ayurvati said, ‘My Lord, your hands would need to be washed as well.’ \\n\\nShiva looted down, noticing Sati’s sweat. He looted up at Ayurvati and nodded, ‘I will do so \\nimmediately.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\n‘This is a miracle, Sati. Nobody has ever recovered from an agnibaan!’ said Ayurvati, \\nbeaming ear to ear. ‘I’ll be honest. I had given up hope. It was the Lord’s faith that has kept you \\nalive.’ \\n\\nSati was lying on her bed wearing a smile and freshly washed clothes. A new bed had been \\nbrought in with freshly laundered and sterilised linen. All traces of the toxic sweat triggered by \\nthe Somras had been removed. \\n\\n‘Oh no,’ said a self-conscious Shiva. ‘I did nothing. It was Sati’s fighting spirit that saved her.’ \\n\\n‘No, Shiva. It was you. Not me,’ said Sati, holding Shiva’s hand without any hint of \\ntentativeness. ‘You have saved me at so many levels. I don’t know how I can even begin to repay \\nyou.’ \\n\\n‘By never saying again that you have to repay me.’ \\n\\nSati smiled even more broadly and held Shiva’s hand tighter. Parvateshwar looked on gloomily \\nat both of them, now unhappy at the open display of their love. \\n\\n‘All right,’said Ayurvati, clapping her hands together as if to signal the end of an episode. \\n‘Much as I would like to sit here and chitchat with all of you, I have workto do.’ \\n\\n‘What work?’asked Shiva playfully. ‘You are a brilliant doctor. You have an exceptional team. \\n\\nI know that every single injured person has been saved. There is nothing more for you to do.’ \\n\\n‘Oh there is, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati with a smile. ‘I have to put on record how the Somras can \\ncure an agnibaan wound. I will present this at the medical council as soon as I return to Devagiri. \\nThis is big news. We must research the curative properties of the Somras. There is a lot of workto \\ndo!’ \\n\\nShiva smiled fondly at Ayurvati. \\n\\nSati whispered, ‘Thankyou Ayurvatiji. Lite thousands of others, I too owe my life to you.’ \\n\\n‘You owe me nothing, Sati. I only did my duty.’ \\n\\nAyurvati bowed with a formal namaste and left the room. \\n\\n‘Well, even I...,’ mumbled Parvateshwar awkwardly, as he waited out. \\n\\nParvateshwar was surprised to find Ayurvati waiting for him outside. She was standing at a \\nsafe distance from the guards. Whatever it was that she wanted to talk about, she did not want the \\nothers to hear. \\n\\n‘What is it, Ayurvati?’ asked Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘I know what’s bothering you Parvateshwar,’ said Ayurvati. \\n\\n‘Then how can you just stand by and watch? I don’t think it is right. I know that this is not the \\ncorrect time to say anything. But I will raise the issue when appropriate.’ \\n\\n‘No, you shouldn’t’ \\n\\n‘How can you say that?’asted a shocked Parvateshwar. ‘You come from a rare family which \\ndid not have even one renegade Brahmin during the rebellion. Lord Ram insisted that the laws had \\nto be followed strictly. He demonstrated repeatedly that even he wasn’t above the law. Shiva is a \\n\\n\\n\\ngood man. I won’t deny that But he cannot be above the law. Nobody can be above the law. \\nOtherwise our society will collapse. You above all should know this.’ \\n\\n‘I know only one thing,’said Ayurvati, determined. ‘If the Neelkanth feels it is right, then it is \\nright.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted at Ayurvati as if he didn’t recognise her. This could not be the woman he \\nknew and admired, the woman who followed the law without exception. Parvateshwar had begun \\nto respect Shiva. But the respect had not turned into unquestioning faith. He did not believe that \\nShiva was the one who would complete Lord Ram’s work. In Parvateshwar’s eyes, only Lord \\nRam deserved absolute obedience. Nobody else. \\n\\n‘In any case,’ said Ayurvati, ‘I have to leave. I have a theory to thinkabout.’ \\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘Really ?’asted Shiva. You mean it is not necessary in Meluha that the Emperor’s first-born son \\nsucceed him?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ replied Sati smiling. \\n\\nShiva and Sati had spent many hours over the previous week talking about matters important \\nand mundane. Sati, while recovering quickly, was still bedridden. The convoy had set up camp at \\nKoonj till such time as the injured were ready to travel. The journey to Lothal had been called \\noff. Shiva and Parvateshwar had decided that it was better to return to Devagiri as soon as the \\nwounded were able to. \\n\\nSati shifted slightly to relieve a bit of the soreness in her back. But she did not let go of Shiva’s \\nhand while doing so. Shiva leaned forward and pushed back a strand of hair that had slipped onto \\nSati’s face. She smiled lovingly at him and continued, ‘You see, till around two hundred and fifty \\nyears back, the children of the kings were not his birth-children but were drawn from the Maika \\nsystem. So there was no question of knowing who the first-born was. We could only know his \\nfirst-adopted.’ \\n\\n‘Fair point.’ \\n\\n‘But in addition, it was not necessary that the first-adopted child would succeed. This was \\nanother one of the laws that Lord Ram instituted for stability and peace. You see, in the olden \\ndays there were many royal families, each with their own small kingdoms.’ \\n\\n‘All right,’ said Shiva, paying as much attention to Sati’s words as to the hypnotising dimples that \\nformed on her cheeks when she spoke. ‘These kings would probably be at war all the time, so that \\none of them could be overlord for however short a period.’ \\n\\n‘Obviously,’smiled Sati, shaking her head at the foolishness of the kings before Lord Ram’s \\ntime. \\n\\n‘Well, it is the same everywhere,’said Shiva, remembering the constant warfare in his part of \\nthe world. \\n\\n‘Battles for supremacy between the kings led to many unnecessary and futile wars, where the \\n\\n\\n\\nonly ones who suffered were the common people,’ continued Sati. ‘Lord Ram felt it was \\nridiculous for the people to suffer so that the egos of their kings were fed. He instituted a system \\nwhere a Rajya Sabha, the ruling council, consisting of all Brahmins and Kshatriyas of a specific \\nrank, was created. Whenever the Emperor died or took sanyas, the council would meet and elect \\na new Emperor from amongst Kshatriyas of the rank of brigadier or above. The decision could \\nnot be contested and was inviolate.’ \\n\\n‘I have said it before and I’ll say it again,’said Shiva with a broad smile. ‘Lord Ram was a \\ngenius.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, he was,’ said Sati, enthusiastically. ‘Jai Shri Ram.’ \\n\\n‘Jai Shri Ram,’repeated Shiva. ‘But tell me, how come your father became the Emperor after \\nLord Brahmanay ak. After all, his Highness is the first born of the previous Emperor, correct?’ \\n\\n‘He was elected, just like every other Emperor of Meluha. Actually it was the first time in \\nMeluhan history that a ruling emperor’s son was elected Emperor,’ said Sati proudly. \\n\\n‘Hmm. But your grandfather helped your father get elected?’ \\n\\n‘I’ve never been sure about that. I know my grandfather would have liked it if my father had \\nbecome Emperor. But I also know that he was a great man who followed the rules of Meluha and \\nwould not openly help his son. Lord Bhrigu, a great sage respected across the land, helped my \\nfather a great deal in his election.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled at her tenderly running his hand across the side of her face. Sati closed her eyes, \\nexulting in the sensation. His hand glided along the side of her body to rest on her hand again. He \\nsqueezed it softly. \\n\\nShiva was about to ask more about the relationship between Daksha and Lord Bhrigu when the \\ndoor suddenly swung open. Daksha, looking deeply exhausted, stormed in. Following him were \\nVeerini and Kanakhala. Shiva immediately withdrew his hand before Daksha could see where it \\nwas. But Daksha had noticed the movement. \\n\\n‘Father! ’ cried a surprised Sati. \\n\\n‘Sati, my child,’sighed Daksha, kneeling next to Sati’s bed. Veerini knelt next to Daksha and ran \\nher hand lovingly over her daughter’s face. She was crying. Kanakhala remained at the door and \\ngreeted Shiva with a formal namaste. Shiva returned Kanakhala’s namaste with a beaming smile. \\nParvateshwar and Ayurvati waited next to Kanakhala, politely leaving the royal family alone in \\ntheir private moment. Nandi, Veerbhadra and Krittika stood behind them. A discrete aide silently \\nbrought in two chairs for the royal couple, placed them next to the bed and leftjustas quietly. \\n\\nDaksha, Veerini and Kanakhala, accompanied by two thousand soldiers, had immediately left \\nDevagiri on hearing the news of Sati’s injury. They had sailed down the Saraswati to the inland \\ndelta of the river and then had ridden night and day to reach Koonj. \\n\\n‘I am alright, father,’said Sati, holding her mother’s hand gently. Turning towards her mother, \\nshe continued, ‘Seriously, mother. I am feeling better than ever. Give me one more weekand I’ll \\ndance for you!’ \\n\\nShiva smiled gently at Sati as Daksha and Veerini broke into a weak laugh. \\n\\nLooking at her father, Sati continued, ‘I am sorry to have caused so much trouble. I know there \\nare much more important tasks at hand and you had to rush here.’ \\n\\n‘Trouble?’asked Daksha. ‘My child, you are my life. You are nothing but a source of joy for \\nme. And at this point of time, you can’t imagine how proud I am of you.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nVeerini bent over and kissed Sati’s forehead tenderly. \\n\\n‘I am proud of all of you,’ continued Daksha looking back at Parvateshwar and Ayurvati. \\n‘Proud that you supported the Lord in what had to be done. We actually fought back a terrorist \\nattack! You can’t imagine how much this has electrified the nation! ’ \\n\\nDaksha soothingly continued to pat Sati’s hand, as he turned to Shiva and said, ‘Thankyou, my \\nLord. Thank you for fighting for us. We know now that we have put our faith in the right man.’ \\n\\nShiva could say nothing but smile awkwardly and acknowledge Daksha’s faith with a slight nod \\nand a courteous namaste. \\n\\nTurning to Ayurvati, Daksha asked, ‘How is she now? I was told she is on her way to a total \\nrecovery.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, your Highness,’said Ayurvati. ‘She should be able to move in another week. And in three \\nweeks, the only memory of the wound would be a scar.’ \\n\\n‘You are not just the best doctor of this generation, Ayurvati,’said Daksha proudly. You are in \\nfact the best doctor of all time.’ \\n\\n‘Oh no, your Highness,’cried a flabbergasted Ayurvati, holding her ears gently to ward off the \\nevil spirits that might get angry at an undeserved compliment. ‘There are many far greater than \\nme. But in this case, the miracle was by the Lord Neelkanth, not me.’ \\n\\nLooking briefly towards a visibly embarrassed Shiva before turning back to Daksha, Ayurvati \\ncontinued, ‘I thought we had lost her. She got the terrible fever after we pulled the agnibaan out. \\nYou know that there are no medicines to cure the agnibaan fever, your Highness. But the Lord \\nrefused to lose hope. It was his idea to give her the Somras.’ \\n\\nDaksha turned to Shiva with a grateful smile and said, ‘I have one more thing to thank you for, \\nmy Lord. My daughter is part of my soul. I wouldn’t have been able to survive without her.’ \\n\\n‘Oh no, I did nothing,’ said Shiva, self-conscious. ‘It was Ayurvati who treated her.’ \\n\\n‘It is nothing but your humility speaking, my Lord,’ said Daksha. ‘You truly are a worthy \\nNeelkanth. In fact, you are a worthy Mahadev! ’ \\n\\nAn astounded Shiva stared at Daksha, his expression serious. He knew who the previous \\nMahadev, the God of Gods, was. He did not believe he deserved to be compared to Lord Rudra. \\nHis deeds did not qualify him for that. \\n\\n‘No, your Highness. You speak too highly of me. I am no Mahadev.’ \\n\\n‘Oh yes you are, my Lord,’ said Kanakhala and Ayurvati almost simultaneously. \\nParvateshwar looted on, silent. \\n\\nNot wanting to press the issue as Shiva disliked being called Mahadev, Daksha turned towards \\nSati, What I don’t understand is why you jumped in front of the Lord to take the arrow. You have \\nnever believed in the legend. You have never had faith in the Neelkanth like I have. Why then did \\nyou risk your own life for the Lord?’ \\n\\nSati did not say anything. She looted down with an uncomfortable smile, embarrassed and ill- \\nat-ease. Daksha turned to Shiva to see him wearing the very same sheepish expression as Sati’s. \\nVeerini looted at her husband intently. She waited for him to rise and speak to Shiva. Daksha \\nsuddenly stood up and waited around the bed towards Shiva, holding his hands in a formal \\nnamaste. A surprised Shiva got up and returned Daksha’s namaste formally, with a slight bow of \\nhis head. \\n\\n‘My Lord, perhaps for the first time in her life, my daughter is tongue-tied in front of me,’said \\n\\n\\n\\nDaksha. ‘And I have come to understand you over time. You will always give to others but never \\naskanything for yourself. Hence I am going to mate the first move here.’ \\n\\nShiva continued to stare at Daksha, frowning. \\n\\n‘I will not lie to you, my Lord,’ continued Daksha. ‘The laws classify my daughter as a \\nvikarma, because she had given birth to a still-born decades back It is not that serious a crime. It \\ncould have been due to the past life karma of the child’s father. But the law of the land is that both \\nthe father and mother be blamed for the tragedy. My darling daughter was put in the category of \\na vikarma, because of this incident.’ \\n\\nShiva looted at Daksha, but his expression was clear that he thought the vikarma law unfair. \\n\\n‘It is believed that vikarma people are carriers of bad fate,’continued Daksha. ‘Hence if she \\nmarries again, she will pass on her bad fate to her husband and possibly her future children.’ \\n\\nVeerini looted at her husband with inscrutable eyes. \\n\\n‘I know my daughter, my Lord,’continued Daksha. ‘I have never seen her do anything even \\nremotely wrong. She is a good woman. In my opinion, the law that condemns her is unfair. But I \\nam only the Emperor. I cannot change the law.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar glared angrily at Daksha, upset that he served an Emperor who held the law in \\nsuch low esteem. \\n\\n‘It breaks my heart that I cannot give my daughter the happy life that she deserves,’ sobbed \\nDaksha. ‘That I cannot save her from the humiliation that a good soul like her suffers daily. What \\nI can do, though, is askyou for help.’ \\n\\nSati looted at her father with loving eyes. \\n\\n‘You are the Neelkanth,’continued Daksha. ‘In fact you are more than that. I genuinely believe \\nyou are a Mahadev, even though I know you don’t like to be called that. You are above the law. \\nYou can change the law if you wish. You can override it if you want.’ \\n\\nAn aghast Parvateshwar glowered at Daksha. How could the Emperor be so dismissive of the \\nlaw? Then his eyes fell on Shiva. His heart sank further. \\n\\nShiva was staring at Daksha with undisguised delight. He had thought that he would have to \\nconvince the Emperor about Sati. But here he was, quite sure that the Emperor was about to offer \\nhis daughter’s hand to him. \\n\\n‘If you decide to take my daughter’s hand, my Lord, no power on earth can stop you,’ \\ncontended Daksha. ‘The question is: do you want to?’ \\n\\nAll the emotions in the universe surged through Shiva’s being. His face bore an ecstatic smile. \\nHe tried to speak but his voice was choked. He bent down, picked up Sati’s hand gently brought it \\nto his lips and kissed it lovingly. He looted up at Daksha and whispered, ‘I will never let go of her. \\nNever.’ \\n\\nA stunned Sati stared at Shiva. She had dared to love over the last week, but had not dared to \\nhope. And now her wildest dream was coming true. She was going to be his wife. \\n\\nAn overjoyed Daksha hugged Shiva tightly and softly said, ‘My Lord!’ \\n\\nVeerini was sobbing uncontrollably. The unfairness done to Sati all her life had been set right. \\nShe looted up at Daksha, almost willing to forgive him. Ayurvati and Kanakhala entered the room \\nand congratulated the Emperor, the Queen, Shiva and Sati. Nandi, Krittika and Veerbhadra, who \\nhad heard the entire conversation, expressed their joy. Parvateshwar stood rooted near the door, \\nfurious at such disregard for Lord Ram’s way. \\n\\n\\n\\nShiva, at long last, regained control of himself. Firmly gripping Sati’s hand, he looted at Daksha, \\n‘But your Highness, I have a condition.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘The vikarma law...’ \\n\\n‘It doesn’t need to be changed, my Lord,’said Daksha. ‘If you decide to marry my daughter, \\nthen the law cannot stop you.’ \\n\\n‘All the same,’ said Shiva. ‘That law must be changed.’ \\n\\n‘Of course, it will be my Lord,’ said a beaming Daksha. Turning towards Kanakhala, he \\ncontinued, ‘Make a proclamation to be signed by the Neelkanth, saying that from now on any \\nnoble woman who gives birth to a still-born child will not be classified as vikarma.’ \\n\\n‘No, your Highness,’interrupted Shiva. ‘That is not what I asked. I want the entire vikarma law \\nscrapped. Nobody will be a vikarma from now on. Bad fate can strike anyone. It is ridiculous to \\nblame their past lives for it.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted at Shiva in surprise. Though he did not like even a comma being changed \\nin any of Lord Ram’s laws, he appreciated that Shiva was remaining true to a fundamental \\ncannon of Lord Ram’s principles — the same law applies to everybody, equally and fairly, \\nwithout exceptions. \\n\\nDaksha however looted at Shiva in shock. This was unexpected. Lite all Meluhans, he too was \\nsuperstitious about the vikarma. His displeasure was not with the vikarma law itself but with his \\ndaughter being classified as one. But he quickly recovered and said, ‘Of course, my Lord. The \\nproclamation will state that the entire vikarma law has been scrapped. Once you sign it, it will \\nbecome law.’ \\n\\n‘Thankyou, your Highness,’ smiled Shiva. \\n\\n‘My daughter’s happy days are starting again,’exulted Daksha, turning to Kanakhala. ‘I want a \\ngrand ceremony at Devagiri when we return. A wedding the likes of which the world has not seen \\nbefore. The most magnificent wedding ever. Call in the best organisers in the land. I want no \\nexpense spared.’ \\n\\nDaksha turned to lookat Shiva for affirmation. Shiva looted at Sati to admire her joyous smile \\nand glorious dimples. Turning towards Daksha, he said, ‘All I want, your Highness, is to get \\nmarried to Sati. I wouldn’t mind the simplest ceremony in the world or the most magnificent. As \\nlong as all of you, Brahaspati and the Gunas are present, I will be happy ’ \\n\\n‘Excellent! ’ rej oiced Daksha. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19 \\n\\n\\nLove Realised \\n\\n\\nThere was an air of celebration in Devagiri when the royal caravan arrived three weeks later. \\nKanakhala, who had arrived in Devagiri earlier, ensured that all the preparations for the most- \\neagerly awaited wedding in a millennium had been accomplished. Her arrangements, as always, \\nhad been impeccable. \\n\\nThe various wedding ceremonies and celebrations had been spread over seven days, each day \\nwith an exuberant variety of events. By the usually sober Suryavanshi standards, the city had \\nbeen decorated extravagantly. Colourful banners hung proudly from the city walls, splashing \\nfestive beauty on the sober grey exteriors. The roads had been freshly tiled in the sacred blue \\ncolour. All the restaurants and shops served their customers free of charge for the seven days of \\nrevelry, subsidised at state expense. All the buildings had been freshly painted at government cost \\nto mate Devagiri appear like a city that had settled the previous day. \\n\\nA massive channel had been rapidly dug along the far side of the Saraswati where a part of the \\nriver had been diverted. The channel was in the open in some parts and went underground in \\nothers. Filters injected a red dye into the water as soon as it entered the channel and removed it \\njust as efficiently when the water flowed back into the river. The channel formed a giant \\nSwastika, an ancient symbol which literally translates to ‘that which is associated with well-being’ \\nor very simply, a lucky charm. From any of the three city platforms, a Meluhan could look in \\nreverence at the enormous impression of the revered Swastika in the royal red Suryavanshi \\ncolour formed by the flow of the holy Saraswati. Some of the protective giant spites around the \\nentry drawbridges of the three platforms had been cleared. In their stead, giant rangolis, visible \\nfrom miles away, had been drawn to welcome all into the capital. Kanakhala had wanted to clear \\nall the spites surrounding Devagiri, but Parvateshwar had vetoed it, citing security reasons. \\n\\nElite families from across the empire had been invited to attend the festivities. People of \\ndistinction ranging from governors to scientists, generals to artists and even sanyasis had trooped \\ninto Devagiri to celebrate the momentous occasion. Ambassadors of eminent countries, such as \\nMesopotamia and Egypt, had been given permits for a rare visit to the capital of Meluha. \\nJhooleshwar had cannily used the distinctive honour granted to ambassadors to wrangle some \\nadditional trade quotas. Brahaspati had come down from Mount Mandar with his retinue. Only a \\nskeletal security staff of Arishtanemi soldiers had been left behind at the mountain. It was the first \\ntime in history that seven days would elapse at Mount Mandar without any experiments! \\n\\nThe first day had two pujas organised in the name of Lord Indra and Lord Agni. They were \\n\\n\\n\\nthe main gods for the people of India and their blessings were sought before any event. And an \\nevent as momentous as the wedding of the millennium could only begin with their sanction. This \\nparticular puja, however, celebrated their warrior form. Daksha eloquently explained the reason. \\nThe Meluhans were not just celebrating the marriage between the Neelkanth and their princess. \\nThey were also celebrating the massive defeat of the despised terrorists at Koonj. According to \\nhim, the echoes of Koonj would reverberate deep in the heart of Swadweep. The Suryavanshi \\nvengeance had begun! \\n\\nThis puja was followed by the formal marriage ceremonies of Shiva and Sati. Though some of \\nthe celebrations were still on, Shiva excused himself and tugged Sati along with him. \\n\\n‘By the Holy Late!’exclaimed Shiva, shutting the door to their private chamber behind him. \\n‘This is only the first day! Is every day going to be as long?’ \\n\\n‘It doesn’t seem to make a difference to you! You waited out when you pretty well pleased!’ \\nteased Sati. \\n\\n‘I don’t care about those damn ceremonies!’growled Shiva, ripping his ceremonial turban off \\nand flinging it aside. He stared at Sati fervently, slowly moving towards her, his breathing heavy. \\n\\n‘Oh yes of course,’ mocked Sati, with a playfully theatrical expression. ‘The Neelkanth gets to \\ndecide what is important and what is not. The Neelkanth can do anything he wants.’ \\n\\n‘Oh yes he can!’ \\n\\nSati laughed mischievously and ran to the other side of the bed. Shiva dashed towards her from \\nthe opposite side hurling his angvastram off in one smooth motion. \\n\\n‘Oh yes he can...’ \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘Remember what I told you to say,’whispered Nandi to Veerbhadra. ‘Don’t worry. The Lord \\nwill give his permission.’ \\n\\n‘What...’ whispered a groggy Shiva as he was woken up gently by Sati. \\n\\n‘Wake up, Shiva,’ whispered Sati tenderly, her hair falling over his face, teasing his cheeks. \\n‘Careful now,’ murmured Sati softly, as Shiva looted at her longingly. ‘Nandi, Krittika and \\nVeerbhadra are waiting at the door. They have something important to tell you.’ \\n\\n‘Hmmm?’ growled Shiva, as he waited towards the door and glared at the trio. ‘What is it \\nNandi? Isn’t there someone beautiful in your life that you would like to bother at this hour instead \\nof troubling me?’ \\n\\n‘There’s nobody lite you, my Lord,’ said Nandi, with a low bow and a chaste namaste. \\n\\n‘Nandi, you better stop this nonsense or you are going to remain a bachelor all your life!’joked \\nShiva. \\n\\nAs everybody laughed out loud, Krittika remained anxious about the task at hand. \\n\\n‘Well, what did you want to talkabout?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\nNandi nudged Veerbhadra roughly. Shiva turned to Veerbhadra with a quizzical look \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Bhadra, since when do you need the support of so many people to speak to me?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Shiva...’ murmured Veerbhadra nervously. \\n\\n‘Yes?’ \\n\\n‘It’s life this...’ \\n\\n‘It’s lil® what?’ \\n\\n‘Well, you see...’ \\n\\n‘I am seeing Bhadra.’ \\n\\n‘Shiva, please don’t mate him more nervous than he is,’said Sati. Looking towards Veerbhadra, \\nshe continued, ‘Veerbhadra, speak fearlessly. You haven’t done anything wrong.’ \\n\\n‘Shiva,’ whispered Veerbhadra timidly, his cheeks the colour of beetroot. ‘I need your \\npermission.’ \\n\\n‘Permission granted,’ said Shiva, amused by now. ‘Whatever it is that you want it for.’ \\n\\n‘Actually, I am considering getting married.’ \\n\\n‘A capital idea!’said Shiva. ‘Now all you have to do is convince some blind woman to marry \\nyou!’ \\n\\n‘Shiva! ’ reprimanded Sati gently. \\n\\n‘Well, I’ve already found a woman,’said Veerbhadra, before his courage could desert him. \\n‘And she’s not blind...’ \\n\\n‘Not blind?!’exclaimed Shiva, his eyebrows humorously arched in wide disbelief. ‘Then she is \\nstupid enough to tie herself for the next seven births to a man who wants someone else to \\ndetermine his marriage!’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra gazed at Shiva with an odd mixture of embarrassment, contrition and \\nincomprehension. \\n\\n‘I have told you before, Bhadra,’said Shiva, There are many customs of our tribe that I don’t \\nlike. And one of the primary ones amongst them is that the leader has to approve the bride of any \\ntribesman. Don’t you remember how we made fun of this ridiculous tradition as children?’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra glanced at Shiva and immediately down again, still unsure. \\n\\n‘For god’s sate man, if you are happy with her, then I am happy for you,’said an exasperated \\nShiva. ‘You have my permission.’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra looted up in surprised ecstasy as Nandi nudged him again. Krittika looted at \\nVeerbhadra, as a long held breath escaped with massive relief. She turned to Sati and silently \\nmouthed the words, ‘Thankyou.’ \\n\\nShiva waited towards Krittika and hugged her warmly. A startled Krittika held back for an \\ninstant, before the warmth of the Neelkanth conquered her Suryavanshi reserve. She returned the \\nembrace. \\n\\n‘Welcome to the tribe,’ whispered Shiva. ‘We are quite mad, but at heart we are good people!’ \\n\\n‘But how did you know,’ said Veerbhadra. ‘I never told you that I loved her.’ \\n\\n‘I am not blind, Bhadra,’ smiled Shiva. \\n\\n‘Thankyou,’ said Krittika to Shiva. ‘Thankyou for accepting me.’ \\n\\nShiva stepped back and said, ‘No. Thankyou. I was always concerned about Bhadra. He is a \\ngood, dependable man, but too simple-minded about women. I was worried about how married \\nlife would treat him. But there is no reason to worry anymore.’ \\n\\n‘Well, I too want to tell you something,’said Krittika. ‘I had never believed in the legend of the \\n\\n\\n\\nNeelkanth. But if you can do to Meluha what you have done to my lady, then you are worthy of \\neven being called the Mahadev! ’ \\n\\n‘I don’t want to be called the Mahadev, Krittika. You know I love Meluha as much as I love Sati. \\nI will do all that I possibly can.’Turning towards Veerbhadra, Shiva ordered, ‘Come here, you \\nstupid oaf! ’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra came forward, embraced Shiva affectionately and whispered, ‘Thankyou.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t be stupid. There’s no need for a “thankyou“! ’ said Shiva with a grin. \\n\\nVeerbhadra smiled broadly. \\n\\n‘And listen!’snarled Shiva in mockanger. ‘You are going to answer to your best friend over the \\nnext chillum we share on how you dared to love another woman for so long without even \\nspeaking to me about it! ’ \\n\\nEverybody laughed out loud. \\n\\n‘Will a good batch of marijuana make up for it?’ asked Veerbhadra, smiling. \\n\\n‘Well, I’ll think about it! ’ \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘Doesn’t she look tired?’ asked a concerned Ayurvati, looking at Sati. \\n\\nSati had just gotten up from the player platform as she and her mother had been excused for \\nthis particular ceremony. This was only for the bridegroom and the father-in-law. The pandits \\nwere preparing for the puja, which would take a few moments. \\n\\n‘Well, it has been six days of almost continuous celebrations and pujas,’ said Kanakhala. \\n‘Though it is the custom that all this be done for a royal wedding, I can understand her being \\ntired.’ \\n\\n‘Oh, I wouldn’t say it has anything to do with the six days of pujas,’ said Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘No?’ asked Kanakhala. \\n\\n‘No,’ answered Brahaspati, mischievously. ‘I think it has to do with the five nights\\' \\n\\n‘What?’exclaimed Ayurvati, then blushed a deep red as the meaning of Brahaspati’s words \\ndawned on her. \\n\\nParvateshwar, who was sitting next to Kanakhala, glared at Brahaspati for the highly improper \\nremark Brahaspati guffawed as the ladies giggled quietly. An assistant pandit turned around in \\nirritation. But on seeing the seniority of the Brahmins sitting behind him, he immediately \\nswallowed his annoyance and returned to his preparations. \\n\\nParvateshwar however had no such compunctions. ‘I can’t believe the kind of conversation I \\nam being forced to endure! ’ He rose to walk to the backof the congregation. \\n\\nThis made even Kanakhala and Ayurvati to chortle. One of the senior pandits turned to signal \\nthat the ceremony was about to begin, making them fall silent immediately. \\n\\nThe pandits resumed the invocations of the shlokas. Both Shiva and Daksha continued to pour \\nthe ceremonial ghee into the sacred fire at regular intervals while saying, ‘Swaha’. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn between two successive swahas, there was enough time for Shiva and Daksha to talk softly to \\neach other. They spoke of Sati. And only Sati. To any neutral observer, it would have been \\ndifficult to decide who loved the princess more. The pandit took a momentary break in his \\nrecitation of the shlokas, the cue for Shiva and Daksha to pour some more ghee into the sacred \\nfire with a ‘Swaha.’ A little ghee spilled onto Daksha hands. As Shiva immediately pulled the \\nnapkin on his side to wipe it off, he noticed the chosen-tribe amulet on Daksha’s arm. He was \\nstunned on seeing the animal there, but had the good sense to not make a comment. Daksha \\nmeanwhile had also turned and noticed Shiva’s gaze. \\n\\n‘It wasn’t my choice. My father chose it for me,’ said Daksha, with a warm smile, while wiping \\nthe ghee off his hands. There was not a hint of embarrassment in his voice. If one looked closely \\nthough, one could see just a hint of defiance in his eyes. \\n\\n‘Oh no, your Highness,’mumbled Shiva, a little mortified. ‘I didn’t mean to look. Please accept \\nmy apologies.’ \\n\\n‘Why should you apologise, my Lord?’asked Daksha. ‘It is my chosen-tribe. It is worn on the \\narm so that everyone can see it and classify me.’ \\n\\n‘But you are much beyond your chosen-tribe, your Highness,’said Shiva politely. ‘You are a \\nfar greater man than what that amulet symbolises.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’smiled Daksha. ‘I really showed the old man, didn’t I? The Neelkanth did not choose to \\nappear in his reign. He came in mine. The terrorists were not defeated in his reign. They were \\ndefeated in mine. And the Chandravanshis were not reformed in his reign. They will be reformed \\nin mine.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled cautiously. Something about the conversation niggled at him. He took one more \\nglance at the amulet on Daksha’s arm. It represented a humble goat, one of the lowest chosen- \\ntribes amongst the Kshatriyas. In fact, some people considered the goat chosen-tribe to be so low \\nthat its wearer could not even be called a full Kshatriya. Shiva turned backtowards the sacred fire \\non receiving the verbal cue from the pandit. Scooping some more ghee, he poured it into the fire \\nwith a ‘Swaha’. \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\nAt nightfall, in the privacy of their chambers, Shiva had considered asking Sati about the \\nrelationship between Emperor Brahmanayak and his son, Daksha. But for some reason, his \\ninstincts told him that he would have to be careful in how he asks the questions. \\n\\n‘How was the relationship between Lord Brahmanayak and your father?’ \\n\\nSati stopped playing with Shiva’s flowing locks. She took a deep breath and whispered, ‘It was \\nstrained at times. They were very different characters. But Lord Bhrigu...’ \\n\\nThe conversation was interrupted by knocking at the door. \\n\\n‘What is it?’ growled Shiva. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’Taman, the doorkeeper, announced nervously. ‘The Chief Scientist Brahaspatij i has \\n\\n\\n\\nrequested an audience with you. He insists that he must meet with you tonight.’ \\n\\nShiva was always happy to meet Brahaspati. But before answering the doorkeeper, he looked at \\nSati with a raised eyebrow. Sati smiled and nodded. She knew of the importance that Shiva \\nattached to his relationship with Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘Let Brahaspatiji in, Taman.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘My friend,’ said Brahaspati. ‘My apologies for disturbing you so late.’ \\n\\n‘You never need to apologise to me, my friend,’ answered Shiva. \\n\\n‘Namaste, Brahaspatij i,’ said Sati, bending to touch the Chief Scientist’s feet. \\n\\n‘Akhand saubhagyavati bhav,\\' said Brahaspati, blessing Sati with the traditional invocation that \\nmay her husband always be alive and by her side. \\n\\n‘Well,’said Shiva to Brahaspati, ‘what is so important that you had to pull yourself out of bed so \\nlate at night?’ \\n\\n‘Actually, I didn’t get the chance to speak to you earlier.’ \\n\\n‘I know,’said Shiva, smiling towards Sati. ‘Our days have been full with one ceremony after \\nanother.’ \\n\\n‘I know,’said Brahaspati nodding. ‘We Suryavanshis love ceremonies! In any case, I wanted to \\ncome and speakwith you personally, since I have to leave for Mount Mandar tomorrow morning’ \\n\\n‘What?’ asked a surprised Shiva. ‘You have survived all this for the last six days. Surely you can \\nsurvive one more?’ \\n\\n‘I know,’said Brahaspati, crinkling his eyes apologetically. ‘I would have loved to stay but there \\nis an experiment that had already been scheduled. The preparations have been going on for \\nmonths. The Mesopotamian material required for it has already been prepared. We are going to \\ntest the stability of the Somras with lesser quantities of water. I have to go early to check that the \\nexperiment starts correctly. My other scientists will remain here to keep you company! ’ \\n\\n‘Right,’ said Shiva sarcastically. ‘I really do love their constant theorising about everything \\nunder the sun.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati laughed. ‘I really do have to go, Shiva. I am sorry’ \\n\\n‘No need to apologise, my friend,’ said Shiva smiling. ‘Life is long. And the road to Mount \\nMandar short. You are not going to get rid of me that easily.’ \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled, his eyes full of love towards a man he had come to consider his brother. He \\nstepped forward and hugged Shiva tightly. Shiva was a little surprised. It was usually Shiva who \\nwould move to embrace Brahaspati first, and Brahaspati would normally respond later, a little \\ntentatively. \\n\\n‘My brother,’ whispered Brahaspati. \\n\\n‘Ditto,’ mumbled Shiva. \\n\\nStepping slightly back but still holding Shiva’s arms, Brahaspati said, ‘I would go anywhere for \\nyou. Even into Patallokif it would help you.’ \\n\\n‘I would never take you there, my friend,’answered Shiva with a grin, thinking that he himself \\nwasn’t about to venture into Patallok, the land of the demons. \\n\\nBrahaspati smiled warmly at Shiva. ‘I hope to see you soon, Shiva.’ \\n\\n‘You can count on it! ’ \\n\\nTurning to Sati, Brahaspati said, ‘Take care, my child. It is so good to see you finally get the life \\n\\n\\n\\nyou deserve.’ \\n\\n‘Thankyou, Brahaspatiji.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20 \\n\\n\\nAttack on Mandar \\n\\n\\n‘How are you, my friend?’ \\n\\n‘What the hell am I doing here?’ asked a starded Shiva. \\n\\nHe found himself sitting in the Brahma temple in Meru. Sitting in front of him was the Pandit \\nwhom he had met during his first visit to Meru, many months back. \\n\\n‘You called me here,’ said the Pandit smiling. \\n\\n‘But how and when did I get here?’ asked Shiva, astounded. \\n\\n‘As soon as you went to sleep,’ replied the Pandit. ‘This is a dream.’ \\n\\n‘I’llbe damned!’ \\n\\n‘Why do you swear so much?’ asked the Pandit frowning. \\n\\n‘I only swear when the occasion demands,’ grinned Shiva. ‘And what’s wrong with swearing?’ \\n\\n‘Well, I think it reflects poor manners. It shows, perhaps, a slight deficiency in character.’ \\n\\n‘On the contrary, I think it shows tremendous character. It shows you have the strength and \\npassion to speakyour mind.’ \\n\\nThe Pandit guffawed, shaking his head slightiy. \\n\\n‘In any case,’continued Shiva. ‘Since you are here, why don’t you tell me what your people \\nare called? I was promised I would be told the next time I met one of you.’ \\n\\n‘But you haven’t met one of us again. This is a dream. I can only tell you what you already \\nknow,’ said the Pandit, smiling mysteriously. ‘Or something that already exists in your \\nconsciousness that you haven’t chosen to listen to as yet.’ \\n\\n‘So that’s what this is about! You are here to help me find something I already know! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said the Pandit, his smile growing more enigmatic. \\n\\n‘Well, what is it that we are supposed to talk about?’ \\n\\n‘The colour of that leaf,’ beamed the Pandit, pointing towards the many trees that could be seen \\nfrom the temple, through its ostentatiously carved pillars. \\n\\n‘The colour of that leaf?! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes.’ \\n\\nFrowning strongly, Shiva sighed, ‘Why, in the name of the Holy Lake, is the colour of that leaf \\nimportant?’ \\n\\n‘Many times a good conversational journey to find knowledge makes attaining it that much \\nmore satisfying,’said the Pandit. ‘And more importantly, it helps you understand the context of \\nthe knowledge much more easily.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Context of the knowledge?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. All knowledge has its context. Unless you know the context, you may not understand the \\npoint.’ \\n\\n‘And I’ll know all that by talking about the colour of that leaf?’ \\n\\n‘Yes.’ \\n\\n‘By the Holy Lake, man! ’ groaned Shiva. ‘Let’s talkabout the leaf then.’ \\n\\n‘All right,’ laughed the Pandit. ‘Tell me. What is the colour of that leaf?’ \\n\\n‘The colour? It’s green.’ \\n\\n‘Is it?’ \\n\\n‘Isn’t it? \\n\\n‘Why do you think it appears green to you?’ \\n\\n‘Because,’ said Shiva, amused, ‘it is green.’ \\n\\n‘No. That wasn’t what I was trying to ask You had a conversation with one of Brahaspati’s \\nscientists about how the eyes see. Didn’t you?’ \\n\\n‘Oh that, right,’said Shiva slapping his forehead. ‘Light falls on an object. And when it reflects \\nbackfrom that object to your eyes, you see that object.’ \\n\\n‘Exactly! And you had another conversation with another scientist about what normal white \\nsunlight is made of.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, I did. White light is nothing but the confluence of seven different colours. That is why the \\nrainbow is made up of seven colours since it is formed when raindrops disperse sunlight.’ \\n\\n‘Correct! Now put these two theories together and answer my question. Why does that leaf \\nappear green to you?’ \\n\\nShiva frowned as his mind worked the problem out. White sunlight falls on that leaf. The leaf’s \\nphysical properties are such that it absorbs the colours violet, indigo, blue, yellow, orange and red. \\nIt doesn’t absorb the colour green, which is then reflected backto my eyes. Hence I see the leaf \\nas green.’ \\n\\n‘Exactly!’beamed the Pandit. ‘So thinkaboutthe colour of that leaf from the perspective of the \\nleaf itself. What colour it absorbs and what it rejects. Is its colour green? Or is it every single \\ncolour in the world, except green?’ \\n\\nShiva was stunned into silence by the simplicity of the argument being presented to him. \\n\\n‘There are many realities. There are many versions of what may appear obvious,’continued \\nthe Pandit. ‘Whatever appears as the unshakeable truth, the exact opposite may also be true in \\nanother context. It is the context or perspective that you’re looking from that moulds which \\nparticular reality you see.’ \\n\\nShiva turned slowly towards the leaf again. Its lustrous green colour shone through in the \\nglorious sunlight. \\n\\n‘Are your eyes capable of seeing another reality?’ asked the Pandit. \\n\\nShiva continued to stare at the leaf as it gradually altered its appearance. The colour seemed to \\nbe dissolving out of the leaf as its bright green hue gradually grew lighter and lighter. It slowly \\nreduced itself to a shade of grey. As a stunned Shiva continued to stare, even the grey seemed to \\ndissolve slowly, till the leaf was almost transparent. Only its outline could be discerned. There \\nappeared to be numerous curved lines of two colours, black and white, moving in and out of the \\noutline of the leaf. It almost appeared as if the leaf was nothing but a carrier, which the black and \\n\\n\\n\\nwhite curved lines used as a temporary stop on their eternal journey. \\n\\nIt took some time for Shiva to realise that the surrounding leaves had also been transformed into \\ntheir outlines. As his eyes panned, he noticed that the entire tree had magically transformed into \\nan outline, with the black and white curved lines flowing in and out, easily and smoothly. He \\nturned his head to soak in the panorama. Every object, from the squirrels on the trees to the pillars \\nof the temple had all been transformed into outlines of their selves. The same black and white \\ncurved lines streamed in and out of them. \\n\\nTurning to the Pandit to askfor an explanation, he was stunned to see that the priest himself was \\nalso transformed into an outline of his former self. White curved lines were flooding out of him \\nwith frightening intensity. Strangely though, there were no black lines around him. \\n\\n‘What the...’ \\n\\nShiva’s words were stopped by the outline of the Pandit pointing backat him. ‘Lookat yourself, \\nmy Karmasaafhi,’advised the Pandit. \\n\\nShiva looked down. ‘I’ll be damned!’ \\n\\nHis body too had been transformed into an outline, completely transparent inside. Torrents of \\nblack curved lines were gushing furiously into him. He looked at the lines closely to notice that \\nthat they were not lines at all. They were, in fact, tiny waves which were j et black in colour. The \\nwaves were so tiny that from even a slight distance, they appeared like lines. There wasn’t even a \\nhint of the white waves close to Shiva’s outlined body. ‘What the hell is going on?’ \\n\\n‘The white waves are positive energy and the black negative,’said the Pandit’s outline. ‘They \\nare both important. Their balance crucial. If they fall out of sync, cataclysm will occur.’ \\n\\nShiva looted up at the Pandit, puzzled. ‘So why is there no positive energy around me? And no \\nnegative energy around you?’ \\n\\n‘Because we balance each other. The Vishnu’s role is to transmit positive energy’said the \\nPandit. The white lines pouring feverishly out of the Pandit seemed to flutter a bit whenever he \\nspoke. ‘And the Mahadev’s role is to absorb the negative. Search for it. Search for negative \\nenergy and you will fulfil your destiny as a Mahadev.’ \\n\\n‘But I am no Mahadev. My deeds till now don’t mate me deserve that tide.’ \\n\\n‘It doesn’t work that way, my friend. You don’t earn a tide after you have done your deeds. \\nYou do your deeds because of and only after you believe that you already are the Mahadev. It \\ndoesn’t matter what others think It’s about what you believe. Believe you are the Mahadev, and \\nyou will be one.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. \\n\\n‘Believe! ’ repeated the Pandit. \\n\\nBOOM! A distant reverberation echoed through the ambience. Shiva turned his eyes towards \\nthe horizon. \\n\\n‘It sounds like an explosion,’ whispered the Pandit’s outline. \\n\\nThe distant, insistent voice of Sati came riding in. ‘S-H-I-V-A...’ \\n\\nBOOM! Another explosion. \\n\\n‘S-H-I-V-A...’ \\n\\n‘It looks like your wife needs you, my friend.’ \\n\\nShiva looted in astonishment at the outline of the Pandit, unable to decipher where the sound \\ncame from. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Maybe you should wake up,’ advised the Pandit’s disembodied voice. \\n\\n‘S-H-I-V-A’ \\n\\nA groggy Shiva woke up to find Sati staring at him with concern. He was still a little bleary \\nfrom the outlandishly strange dream state that he had just been y anted out of. \\n\\n‘Shiva!’ \\n\\nBOOM! \\n\\n‘What the hell was that?’ cried Shiva, alert now. \\n\\n‘Someone is using daivi astras! ’ \\n\\n‘What? What are daivi astras?\\' \\n\\nA clearly stunned Sati spoke agitatedly, ‘Divine weapons\\'. But Lord Rudra destroyed all the \\ndaivi astras! Nobody has access to them anymore!’ \\n\\nShiva was completely alert by now, his battle instincts primed. ‘Sati, get ready. Wear your \\narmour. Bind your weapons.’ \\n\\nSati responded swiftly. Shiva slipped on his armour, coupled his shield to it and tied his sword to \\nhis waist. He slipped on his quiver smoothly and picked up his bow. Noting that Sati was ready, he \\nkicked the door open. Taman and eight other guards had their swords drawn, ready to defend their \\nNeelkanth against any attack \\n\\n‘My Lord, you should wait inside,’ said Taman. ‘We will hold the attackers here.’ \\n\\nShiva stared hard at Taman, his eyes frowning at Taman’s well-intentioned words. Taman \\nimmediately stepped aside. ‘I am sorry, my Lord. We will follow you.’ \\n\\nBefore Shiva could react, they heard footsteps rushing in their hallway. Shiva immediately \\ndrew his sword. He strained his ears to assess the threat. \\n\\nFour footsteps. Just two men to attacka royal hallway! This didn’t mate sense. \\n\\nOne pair of footsteps dragged slightly. The terrorist was clearly a large man using considerable \\nwillpower to mate his feet move faster than his girth allowed. \\n\\n‘Stand down, soldiers,’ ordered Shiva suddenly. ‘They are friends.’ \\n\\nNandi and Veerbhadra emerged around the corner, running hard, with their swords at the \\nready. \\n\\n‘Are you alright, my Lord?’ asked Nandi, admirably not out of breath. \\n\\n‘Yes. We are all safe. Did the two of you face any attacks?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ answered Veerbhadra, frowning. ‘What the hell is going on?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know,’ said Shiva. ‘But we’re going to find out.’ \\n\\n‘Where’s Krittika?’ asked Sati. \\n\\n‘Safe in her room,’ answered Veerbhadra. ‘There are five soldiers with her. The room is \\nbarred from the inside.’ \\n\\nSati nodded, before turning to Shiva. ‘What now?’ \\n\\n‘I want to checkon the Emperor first. Everybody, files of two. Keep your shields up for cover. \\nSati at my side. Nandi in the middle. Taman, Veerbhadra, at the rear. Don’t light any torches. We \\nknow the way. Our enemies don’t.’ \\n\\nThe platoon moved with considerable speed and stealth, mindful of possible surprise attacks \\nfrom the terrorists. Shiva was troubled by what he had heard. Or rather, what he didn’t. Apart \\nfrom the repeated explosions, there was absolutely no other sound from the palace. No screams \\nof terror. No sound of panicked footsteps. No clash of steel. Nothing. Either the terrorists had not \\n\\n\\n\\nbegun their real attack as yet. Or, Shiva was late and the attack was already over. Shiva frowned \\nas a third alternative occurred to him. Maybe there were no terrorists in the palace itself. Maybe \\nthe attackwas being mounted from a distance, with the daivi astras that Sati spoke of. \\n\\nShiva’s platoon reached Daksha’s chambers to find his guards at the door tense and ready for \\nbattle. \\n\\n‘Where is the Emperor?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘He is inside, my Lord,’ said the royal guard captain, recognising the Neelkanth’s silhouette \\nimmediately. ‘Where are they, my Lord? We’ve been waiting for an attack since the first \\nexplosion.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know, Captain,’replied Shiva. ‘Stay here and block the doorway. Taman, support the \\ncaptain here with your men. And remain alert’ \\n\\nShiva opened the Emperor’s door. ‘Your Highness?’ \\n\\n‘My Lord? Is Sati all right?’ asked Daksha. \\n\\n‘Yes, she is, your Highness,’said Shiva, as Sati, Nandi and Veerbhadra followed him into the \\nchamber. ‘And the Queen?’ \\n\\n‘Shaken. But not too scared.’ \\n\\n‘What was that?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know,’answered Daksha. ‘I would suggest that you and Sati stay here for now till we \\nknow what’s going on.’ \\n\\n‘Perhaps it maybe advisable for you to stay here, your Highness. We cannot risk any harm \\ncoming to you. I am going out to help Parvateshwar. If there’s a terrorist attack on, we need all \\nthe strength we have.’ \\n\\n‘You don’t have to go, my Lord. This is Devagiri. Our soldiers will slay all the terrorists dim- \\nwitted enough to attackour capital.’ \\n\\nBefore Shiva could respond, there was a loud insistent knocking on the door. \\n\\n‘Your Highness? Request permission to enter.’ \\n\\n1 Parvateshwar ! ’ thought Daksha. ‘Observing protocol even at a time like this\\\\ ’ \\n\\n‘Come in!’growled Daksha. As Parvateshwar entered, Daksha let fly. ‘How in Lord Indra’s \\nname can this happen, General? An attackon Devagiri? How dare they?’ \\n\\n‘Your Highness,’intercepted Shiva. Sati, Nandi and Veerbhadra were in the chambers now. He \\ncould not allow Parvateshwar to be insulted in front of them, especially in front of Sati. ‘Let us \\nfind out what is going on first.’ \\n\\n‘The attack is not on Devagiri, your Highness,’glared Parvateshwar, his impatience with his \\nEmperor on edge. ‘My scouts saw massive plumes of smote coming from the direction of Mount \\nMandar. I believe it is under attack I have already given orders for my troops and the station \\nArishtanemi to be ready. We leave in an hour. I need your approval to depart.’ \\n\\n‘The explosions were in Mandar, Pitratulya?’ asked Sati incredulously. ‘How powerful were \\nthey to be heard in Devagiri.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted gloomily at Sati, his silence conveying his deepest fears. He turned \\ntowards Daksha. ‘Your Highness?’ \\n\\nDaksha seemed stunned into silence. Or was that a frown on his eyes. Parvateshwar could not \\nbe sure in the dim light. \\n\\n‘Guards, light the torches! ’ ordered Parvateshwar. ‘There is no attackon Devagiri! ’ \\n\\n\\n\\nAs the torches spread their radiance, Parvateshwar repeated, ‘Do I have your permission, my \\nLord?’ \\n\\nDaksha nodded softly. \\n\\nParvateshwar turned to see Shiva looking shocked. ‘What happened, Shiva?’ \\n\\n‘Brahaspati left for Mount Mandar yesterday.’ \\n\\n‘What?’asked a startled Parvateshwar, who had not noticed the chief scientist’s absence in the \\ncelebrations of the previous day. ‘O Lord Agni! ’ \\n\\nShiva turned slowly towards Sati, drawing strength from her presence. \\n\\n‘I will find him, Shiva,’ consoled Parvateshwar. ‘I am sure he is alive. I will find him.’ \\n\\n‘I’m coming with you,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘And so am I,’ said Sati. \\n\\n‘What?’ asked Daksha, the light making his agonised expression clear. ‘You both don’t need to \\ngo-’ \\n\\nShiva turned to Daksha, frowning. ‘My apologies, your Highness. But I must go. Brahaspati \\nneeds me.’ \\n\\nAs Parvateshwar and Shiva turned to leave the royal chambers, Sati bent down to touch her \\nfather’s feet. Daksha seemed too dazed to bless her and Sati did not want to remain too far behind \\nher husband. She quickly turned to touch her mother’s feet. \\n\\n‘Ayushman bhav ’ said Veerini. \\n\\nSati frowned at the odd blessing — ‘\\'May you live long\\'. She was going into a battle. She wanted \\nvictory, not a long life! But there was little time to argue. Sati turned and raced behind Shiva as \\nNandi and Veerbhadra followed closely. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21 \\n\\n\\nPreparation for War \\n\\nThe noise of the explosions stopped within an hour of the first. It wasn’t much later that Shiva, \\nParvateshwar, Sati, Nandi and Veerbhadra, accompanied by a brigade of one thousand five \\nhundred cavalry, were on their way to Mount Mandar. Brahaspati’s scientists rode with the \\nbrigade, sick with worry over their leader’s fate. They rode hard and hoped to cover the day— \\nlong distance to the mountain in fewer than eight hours. It was almost at the end of the second \\nprahar, with the sun directly overhead that the brigade turned the last corner of the road where \\nthe forest cover cleared to give them their first glimpse of the mountain. \\n\\nA furious cry arose as they got their first sight of what was the heart of their empire. Mandar \\nhad been ruthlessly destroyed. The mountain had a colossal crater at its centre. It was almost as if \\na giant Asura had struck his massive hands right through the core of the mountain and scooped out \\nits core. The enormous buildings of science were in ruins, their remnants scattered across the \\nplains below. The giant churners at the bottom of mountain were still functioning, their eerie \\nsound making the gruesome picture even more macabre. \\n\\n‘Brahaspati! ’ roared Shiva, as he rode hard, right into the heart of the mountain, where the \\npathway, miraculously, still stood strong. \\n\\n‘Wait Shiva,’ called out Parvateshwar. ‘It could be a trap.’ \\n\\nShiva, unmindful of any danger, continued to gallop up the pathway through the devastated \\nheart of the mountain. The brigade, with Parvateshwar and Sati in the lead, rode fast, trying to \\nkeep up with their Neelkanth. They reached the top to be horrified by the sight they saw. Parts of \\nthe buildings hung limply on broken foundations, some structures still smouldering. Scorched and \\nunrecognisable body parts, ripped apart by the repeated explosions, were strewn all over. It was \\nimpossible to even identify the dead. \\n\\nShiva tumbled off his horse, his face devoid of even a ray of hope. Nobody could have \\nsurvived such a lethal attack ‘Brahaspati...’ \\n\\n— *(G)m - \\n\\n\\n\\n‘How did the terrorists get their hands on the daivi astras?’asked an agitated Parvateshwar, the \\nfire of vengeance blazing within him. \\n\\nThe soldiers had been ordered to collect all the body parts and cremate them in separate pyres, \\nto help the departed on their onward j ourney. A manifest was being drawn up of the names of \\nthose believed dead. The first name on the list was that of Brahaspati, Chief Scientist of Meluha, \\nSarayupaari Brahmin, Swan chosen-tribe. The others were mostly Arishtanemi, assigned to the \\ntask of protecting Mandar. It was a small consolation that the casualties were minimal since most \\nof the mountain’s residents were in Devagiri for the Neelkanth’s marriage. The list was going to \\nbe sent to the great sanyasis in Kashmir, whose powers over the spiritual force were considered \\nsecond to none. If the sanyasis could be cajoled into reciting prayers for these departed souls, it \\nwas hoped that their grisly death in this birth would not mar their subsequent births. \\n\\n‘It could have also been the Somras, general,’said Panini, one of Brahaspati’s assistant chief \\nscientists, offering another plausible cause. \\n\\nShiva looked up suddenly on hearing Panini’s words. \\n\\n‘The Somras did this! How?’ asked a disbelieving Sati. \\n\\n‘The Somras is very unstable during its manufacturing process,’continued Panini. ‘It is kept \\nstable by using copious quantities of the Saraswati waters. One of our main projects was to \\ndetermine whether we could stabilise the Somras using less water. Much lesser than at present.’ \\n\\nShiva remembered Brahaspati talking about this. He leaned over to listen intendly to Panini. \\n\\n‘It was one of the dream projects of...’Panini found it hard to complete the statement. The \\nthought that Brahaspati, the greatest scientist of his generation, the father-figure to all the learned \\nmen at Mount Mandar, was gone, was too much for Panini to bear. He was too choked to release \\nthe intense pain he felt inside. He stopped talking, shut his eyes and hoped the terrible moment \\nwould pass. Regaining a semblance of control over himself, he continued, ‘It was one of \\nBrahaspatij i’s dream projects. He had come back to organise the experiment that was to begin \\ntoday. He didn’t want us to miss the last day of the celebrations. So he came alone.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar was numb. ‘You mean this could have been an accident.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’replied Panini. ‘We all knew the experiment was risk/. Maybe that is why Brahaspatij i \\ndecided to begin without us.’ \\n\\nThe entire room was stunned into silence by this unexpected information. Panini retreated into \\nhis private hell. Parvateshwar continued to gaze into the distance, shocked by the turn of events. \\nSad stared at Shiva, holding his hand, deeply worried about how her husband was taking the death \\nof his friend. And that it may all have been just a senseless mishap! \\n\\n— - \\n\\nIt was late into the first hour of the fourth prahar. It had been decided that the brigade would set \\nup camp at the bottom of the ruined mountain. They would leave the next day, only after all the \\nceremonies for the departed had been completed. Two riders had been dispatched to Devagiri \\n\\n\\n\\nwith the news about Mandar. Parvateshwar and Sati sat at the edge of the mountain peak, \\nwhispering to each other. The drone of Brahmin scientists reciting Sanskrit shlokas at the bottom of \\nthe mountain floated up to create an ethereal atmosphere of pathos. Nandi and Veerbhadra stood \\nat attention, a polite distance from Parvateshwar and Sati, looking at their Lord. \\n\\nShiva was walking around the ruins of the Mandar buildings, lost in thought. It was tearing him \\napart that he hadn’t even seen any recognisable part of Brahaspati. Everybody in Mandar had \\nbeen destroyed beyond recognition. He desperately searched for some sign of his friend. \\nSomething he could keep with himself. Something he could cling on to. Something to soothe his \\ntortured soul for the years of mourning he would go through. He waited at a snail’s pace; his eyes \\ncombing the ground. They suddenly fell upon an object he recognised only too well. \\n\\nHe slowly bent down to pick it up. It was a bracelet of leather, burnt at the edges, its back-hold \\ndestroyed. The heat of the fiery explosions had scarred its brown colour into blackat most places. \\nThe centre however, with an embroidered design, lay astonishingly unblemished. Shiva brought it \\nclose to his eyes. \\n\\nThe crimson hue of the setting sun caused the Aum symbol to glow. At the meeting point of the \\ntop and bottom curve of the Aum were two serpent heads. The third curve, surging out to the east, \\nended in a sharp serpent head, with its fork tongue struck out threateningly. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was him! He killed Brahaspati! \\n\\nShiva swung around, eyes desperately scanning the limbs scattered about, hoping to find the \\nowner of the bracelet or some part of him there. But there was nothing. Shiva screamed silently. \\nA scream audible only to him and Brahaspati’s wounded soul. He clutched the bracelet in his fist \\ntill it’s still burning embers burnt into his palms. Clasping it even more firmly, he swore a terrible \\nvengeance. He vowed to bring upon the Naga a death that would scar him for his next seven \\nbirths. That Naga, and his entire army of vice, would be arinihilated. Piece by bloody piece. \\n\\n‘Shiva! Shiva! ’ The insistent call y anted him back to reality. \\n\\nSati was standing in front of him, gently touching his hand. Parvateshwar stood next to her, \\ndisturbed. Nandi and Veerbhadra stood to the other side. \\n\\n‘Let it go, Shiva,’ said Sati. \\n\\nShiva continued to stare at her, blank. \\n\\n‘Let it go, Shiva,’ repeated Sati softly. ‘It’s singeing your hand.’ \\n\\nShiva opened his palm. Nandi immediately lunged forward to pull the bracelet out. Screaming \\n\\n\\n\\nin surprised agony, Nandi dropped the bracelet as it scalded his hand. How did the Lord hold it for \\nso long? \\n\\nShiva immediately bent down and picked up the bracelet. This time carefully. His fingers were \\nholding the less charred edge, the part with the Aum symbol. He turned to Parvateshwar. ‘It was \\nnot an accident.’ \\n\\n‘What?’ cried a startled Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Are you sure?’ asked Sati. \\n\\nShiva looked towards Sati and raised the bracelet, the serpent Aum clearly in view. Sati let out a \\ngasp of shock. Parvateshwar, Nandi and Veerbhadra immediately closed in to stare intently at the \\nbracelet. \\n\\n‘Naga...,’ whispered Nandi. \\n\\n‘The same bastard who attacked Sati in Meru,’growled Shiva. ‘The same Naga who attacked us \\non our return from Mandar. The very, bloody, same, son of a bitch.’ \\n\\n‘He will pay for this Shiva,’ said Veerbhadra. \\n\\nTurning towards Parvateshwar, Shiva said, ‘We ride to Devagiri tonight. We declare war.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar nodded. \\n\\n\\n— aom - \\n\\nThe Meluhan war council sat quietly, observing five minutes of silence in honour of the \\nmartyrs of Mandar. General Parvateshwar and his twenty-five brigadiers sat to the right of \\nEmperor Daksha. To Daksha’s left sat the Neelkanth, the administrative Brahmins led by Prime \\nMinister Kanakhala and the governors of the fifteen provinces. \\n\\n‘The decision of the council is a given,’said Daksha, beginning the proceedings. ‘The question is \\nwhen do we attack?’ ‘It will take us at the most a month to be ready to march, your Highness,’ said \\nParvateshwar. ‘You know that there are no roads between Meluha and Swadweep. Our army \\nwould have to travel through dense, impenetrable forests. So even if we begin the march in a \\nmonth, we will not be in Swadweep before three months from today. So time is of the essence.’ \\n\\n‘Then let the preparations begin.’ \\n\\n‘Your Highness,’said Kanakhala, adding a Brahmin voice of reason to the battle cry of the \\nKshatriyas. ‘May I suggest an alternate?’ \\n\\n‘An alternate?’ asked a surprised Daksha. \\n\\n‘Please don’t get me wrong,’said Kanakhala. ‘I understand the rage of the entire nation over \\nMandar. But we want vengeance against the perpetrators of the crime, not all of Swadweep. \\nCould we try and see whether a scalpel might workbefore we bring out the mighty war sword?’ \\n\\n‘The path you suggest is one of cowardice, Kanakhala,’ said Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘No Parvateshwar, I am not suggesting that we sit like cowards and do nothing,’said Kanakhala \\npolitely. ‘I am only suggesting a way to see whether we can get our vengeance without \\nsacrificing the lives of our soldiers and other innocents.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘My soldiers are willing to shed their blood for the country, Madam Prime Minister.’ \\n\\n‘I know they are,’said Kanakhala, maintaining her composure. ‘And I know that you too are \\nwilling to shed your blood for Meluha. My point is that can we send an emissary to Emperor \\nDilipa and request him to surrender the terrorists who perpetrated this attack? We can threaten \\nthat if he doesn’t, we will attack with all the might at our disposal.’ \\n\\nHis eyes scowling with impatience, Parvateshwar said, ‘Request him? And why would he \\nlisten? For decades, the Swadweepans have got away with their nefarious activities because they \\nthink we don’t have the stomach for fight. And if we talk about this “scalpel approach” after an \\noutrage like Mount Mandar, they will be convinced that they can mount any attack at will and we \\nwill not respond.’ \\n\\n‘I disagree, Parvateshwar,’said Kanakhala. ‘They have mounted terrorist attacks because they \\nare scared that they cannot take us on in a direct fight. They are afraid that they cannot withstand \\nour superior technology and war-machines. I am only looking from the standpoint of what Lord \\nShiva had said when he had first come here. Can we try talking to them before we fight? This \\nmay be an opportunity to get them to admit that there are sections in their society who are \\nterrorists. If they hand them over, we may even find ways of coexisting.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t think Shiva thinks like that any more,’said Parvateshwar, pointing towards the Neelkanth. \\n‘He too wants vengeance.’ \\n\\nShiva sat silently, his face expressionless. Only his eyes glowered with the terrible anger \\nseething inside. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’said Kanakhala looking towards Shiva, her hands folded in a namaste. ‘I hope that at \\nleast you understand what I am trying to say. Even Brahaspati would have wanted us to avoid \\nviolence, if possible.’ \\n\\nThe last sentence had an effect on Shiva similar to a torrential downpour on a raging fire. He \\nturned towards Kanakhala and gazed into her eyes, before turning towards Daksha. ‘Your \\nHighness, perhaps what Kanakhala says is right. Maybe we can send an emissary to Swadweep \\nto give them an opportunity to repent. If we can avoid the killing of innocents, only good will \\ncome from it. However, I would still suggest that we begin war preparations. We should be \\nprepared for the possibility that the Chandravanshis may reject our offer.’ \\n\\n‘The Mahadev has spoken,’said Daksha. ‘I propose that this be the decision of the war council. \\nAll in favour, raise your hands.’ \\n\\nEvery hand in the room was raised. The die had been cast. There would be an attempt for \\npeace. If that didn’t work, the Meluhans would attack \\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘I have failed again, Bhadra,’ cried Shiva. ‘I can’t protect anyone in need.’ \\n\\nShiva was sitting next to Veerbhadra, in a private section of his palace courtyard. A deeply \\nworried Sati had invited Veerbhadra to try and bring Shiva out of his mourning. Shiva had \\n\\n\\n\\nretreated into a shell, not speaking, not crying. She hoped her husband’s childhood friend would \\nsucceed where she had failed. \\n\\n‘How can you blame yourself, Shiva?’ asked Veerbhadra, handing over the chillum to his \\nfriend. ‘How can this be your fault?’ \\n\\nShiva picked up the chillum and took a deep drag. The marijuana coursed through his body, but \\ndid not help. The pain was too intense. Shiva snorted in disgust and threw the chillum away. As \\ntears flooded his eyes, he looted up to the sky and swore, ‘I will avenge you, my brother. If it is \\nthe last thing I do. If I have to spend every moment of the rest of my life. If I have to come back \\nto this world again and again. I will avenge you! ’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra turned towards Sati sitting in the distance, a worried look on his face. Sati got up \\nand waited towards them. She came up to Shiva and held him tight, resting his tired head against \\nher bosom, hoping to soothe Shiva’s tortured soul. To Sati’s surprise, Shiva did not raise his arms to \\nwrap them around her. He just sat motionless. Breathing intermittently. \\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ cried a surprised Vraka, as he stood to attention. So did the other twenty-four \\nbrigadiers, with respect to the Neelkanth who had just been announced into the war room. \\n\\nParvateshwar rose slowly. He spoke kindly as he knew the pain Shiva still carried about \\nBrahaspati’s grisly death. ‘How are you, Shiva?’ \\n\\n‘I am alright, thank you.’ \\n\\n‘We were discussing battle plans.’ \\n\\n‘I know,’ said Shiva. ‘I was wondering if I could join in.’ \\n\\n‘Of course,’ said Parvateshwar, as he moved his chair to the side. \\n\\n‘The essential problem for us,’said Parvateshwar, trying to quickly bring Shiva up to date, ‘is \\nthe transport links between Meluha and Swadweep.’ \\n\\n‘There aren’t any, right?’ \\n\\n‘Right,’ answered Parvateshwar. ‘The Chandravanshis followed a “broken earth” policy after \\ntheir last defeat at our hands a hundred years back. They destroyed the entire infrastructure that \\nexisted between Meluha and Swadweep. They depopulated their border cities and moved them \\ndeeper into their empire. Forests grew where cities and roads used to be. There is no river that \\nflows from our territory to theirs. Basically, there is no way for our huge, technologically \\nsuperior, war-machines to be transported to the borders of Swadweep.’ \\n\\n‘That was their aim, obviously,’said Shiva. ‘Your superiority is technology. Their superiority is \\ntheir numbers. They have negated your strength.’ \\n\\n‘Exatly. And if our war-machines are taken out of the equation, our one hundred thousand \\nstrong army may get inundated by their million soldiers.’ \\n\\n‘They have a million strong army?’ asked Shiva, incredulous. \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Vraka. ‘We can’t be absolutely sure, but that is our estimate. However, we \\n\\n\\n\\nalso estimate that the regulars in that army would not be more than a hundred thousand. The rest \\nwould be part-timers. Essentially, people such as small traders, artisans, farmers and any other \\nwithout influence. They would be forcibly conscripted and used as cannon fodder.’ \\n\\n‘Disgusting,’said Parvateshwar. ‘Risking the lives of Shudras and Vaishyas for a job that should \\nbe done by Kshatriyas. Their Kshatriyas have no honour.’ \\n\\nShiva looked towards Parvateshwar and nodded. ‘Can’t we dismantle our war-machines, carry \\nthem to Swadweep and reassemble them?’ \\n\\n‘Yes we can,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘But that is technically possible only for a few. Our most \\ndevastating machines which would give us the edge, like the long-range catapult, cannot be \\nassembled outside a factory’ \\n\\n‘The long-range catapult?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ answered Parvateshwar. ‘It can hurl huge boulders and smouldering barrels over \\ndistances of over a kilometre. If used effectively, they can soften, even devastate, the enemy \\nlines before our cavalry and infantry charge. Basically, the role that elephants used to play \\nearlier.’ \\n\\n‘Then why not use elephants?’ \\n\\n‘They are unpredictable. No matter how long you train them, an army often loses control over \\nthem in the heat of battle. In fact, in the previous war with the Swadweepans, it was their own \\nelephants who were their downfall.’ \\n\\n‘Really?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes,’answered Parvateshwar. ‘Our ploy of firing at the mahouts and generating tremendous \\nnoise with our war drums worked. The Chandravanshi elephants panicked and ran into their own \\narmy, shattering their lines, especially the ones composed of irregulars. All we had to do was \\ncharge in and finish the j ob.’ \\n\\n‘No elephants then.’ \\n\\n‘Absolutely,’ said Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘So we need something that we can take with us and which can be used to soften their irregulars \\nin order to negate their numerical superiority.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar nodded. Shiva looted into the distance, towards the window, where a stiff \\nmorning breeze caused the leaves to flutter. The leaves were green. Shiva stared harder. They \\nremained green. \\n\\n‘I know,’said Shiva, looking at Parvateshwar suddenly, his face luminescent. ‘Why don’t we \\nuse arrows?’ \\n\\n‘Arrows?’ asked a surprised Parvateshwar. \\n\\nArchery was the battle art of the most elite Kshatriyas, used for one-on-one duels. However, \\nsince one-on-one duels could only be fought between warriors of equal chosen-tribes, this skill \\nwas reduced to only a demonstration art of the creme de la creme. Archers earned huge respect \\nfor their rare skill, but they were not decisive in battles. There was a time when bows and arrows \\nwere crucial in war strategies as weapons of mass destruction. That was the time of the daivi \\nastras. Many of these astras were usually released through arrows. However, with the ban on \\ndaivi astras many thousands of years ago by Lord Rudra, the effectiveness of archery units in \\nlarge-scale battles had reduced drastically. \\n\\n‘How can that reduce their numerical superiority, my Lord?’ asked Vraka. ‘Even the most \\n\\n\\n\\nskilled of archers will take at least five seconds to aim, fire and execute a kill. He will not be able \\nto kill more than twelve a minute. We have only one hundred Kshatriyas who are of the gold \\norder of archers. The rest can shoot, but their aim cannot be relied upon. So we will not be able to \\nkill more than one thousand two hundred of our enemies per minute. Certainly not enough against \\nthe Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘I am not talking about using arrows for one-on-one shooting,’ said Shiva. ‘I am talking about \\nusing them for softening the enemy, as weapons of mass destruction.’ \\n\\nDisregarding the confused expressions of his audience, Shiva continued, ‘Let me explain. \\nSuppose we create a corps of archers of the lower Kshatriya chosen-tribes.’ \\n\\n‘But their aim wouldn’t be good,’ said Vraka. \\n\\n‘That doesn’t matter. Let us say we have at least five thousand of those archers. Suppose we \\ntrain them to just get the range right. Forget about the aim. Suppose their job is to just keep firing \\narrows in the general direction of the Chandravanshi army. If they don’t have to aim, they can \\nfire a lot more quickly. Maybe one arrow every two or three seconds.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar narrowed his eyes as the brilliance of the idea struck him. The rest of his \\nbrigadiers were still trying to gather their thoughts. \\n\\n‘Think about it,’ said Shiva. ‘We would have five thousand arrows raining down on the \\nChandravanshis every two seconds. Suppose we keep this attack on for ten minutes. An almost \\ncontinuous shower of arrows. Their irregulars would break. The arrows would have the same \\neffect like that of the elephants in the last war! ’ \\n\\n‘Brilliant! ’ cried Vraka. \\n\\n‘And maybe,’said Parvateshwar. ‘If the aim doesn’t matter, we could train these archers to lie \\non their back, hold the bow on their feet and pull the string back nearly up to their necks and then \\nrelease. As long as their feet are pointed in the right direction, it would work.’ \\n\\n‘Excellent! ’ exclaimed Shiva. ‘Because then the bows can be bigger. And the range longer.’ \\n\\n‘And the arrows bigger and thicker, almost like small spears,’continued Parvateshwar. ‘Strong \\nenough to even penetrate leather and thick wood shields. Only the soldiers with metal shields, like \\nthe regulars, would be safe from this.’ \\n\\n‘Do we have our answer?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Yes, we do,’ answered Parvateshwar with a smile. He turned towards Vraka. ‘Create this \\ncorps. I want five thousand men ready within two weeks.’ \\n\\n‘It will be done, my Lord,’ said Vraka. \\n\\n— — \\n\\n‘What do you want to talk about, Shiva?’asked Parvateshwar, as he entered the metallurgy \\nfactory. He was accompanied by Vraka and Prasanjit, as per Shiva’s request. Vraka had \\nreluctanly left the archery corps he had been training over the past week However, he had been \\nmotivated to attend with the expectation of another brilliant idea from the Neelkanth. He was not \\n\\n\\n\\ndisappointed. \\n\\n‘I was thinking,’said Shiva, ‘we would still need an equivalent of your stabbing ram to break \\ntheir centre. The centre is where I assume their general would place their regulars. As long as \\nthey hold, our victory cannot be guaranteed.’ \\n\\n‘Right,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘And we have to assume that these soldiers would be disciplined \\nenough to stay in formation despite the barrage of arrows.’ \\n\\n‘Exactly,’ said Shiva. ‘We can’t transport the ram, right?’ \\n\\n‘No we can’t, my Lord’ said Vraka. \\n\\n‘How about if we try to create a human ram?’ \\n\\n‘Go ahead,’ said Parvateshwar slowly, listening intendly. \\n\\n‘Say we align the soldiers into a square of twenty men by twenty men,’said Shiva. ‘Say we \\nhave each one use his shield to cover the left half of his own body and the right half of the soldier \\nto the left of him.’ \\n\\n‘That will allow them to push their spear through between the shields,’ said Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Exactly,’said Shiva. ‘And the soldiers behind use their shields as a lid to cover themselves and \\nthe soldier in front. This formation would be like a tortoise. With the shields holding against any \\nattack, much like a tortoise’s shell, the enemy will not be able to breakthrough, but our spears will \\ncut into them.’ \\n\\n‘And we could have the strongest and most experienced soldiers at the front to make sure the \\ntortoise is well led,’ said Prasanj it. \\n\\n‘No,’said Parvateshwar. ‘Have the most experienced at the back and the sides. To mate sure \\nthat the square doesn’t break in case the younger soldiers panic. This entire formation works only \\nif the team stays together.’ \\n\\n‘Right,’said Shiva, smiling at Parvateshwar’s quick insight. ‘And what if, instead of the usual \\nspears, they carried this?’ \\n\\nShiva raised a weapon that he had designed and the army metallurgy team had quickly \\nassembled. Parvateshwar marvelled at the simple brilliance of it. It had the body of a spear. But \\nits head had been broadened. On to the broadened head, two more spites had been added, to the \\nleft and right of the main spear spite. Assaulting an enemy with this weapon would be like striking \\nhim with three spears at the same time. \\n\\n‘Absolutely brilliant Shiva,’ marvelled Parvateshwar. ‘What do you call it?’ ‘I call it a trishui.’ \\n\\n‘Prasanj it,’said Parvateshwar. ‘You site in charge of creating this corps. I want at least five \\ntortoise formations ready by the time we march. I will assign two thousand men to you for this.’ \\n\\n‘It will be done, my Lord,’ said Prasanj it with a military salute. \\n\\nParvateshwar gazed at Shiva with respect. He thought Shiva’s ideas were brilliant. And the fact \\nthat he had come up with these tactics despite his profound personal grief was worthy of \\nadmiration. Maybe what the others say about Shiva could be true. Maybe he is the man who will \\nfinish Lord Ram’s task. Parvateshwar hoped that Shiva would not prove him wrong. \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\nShiva sat in the royal meeting room, with Daksha and Parvateshwar at his side. Two legendary \\nArishtanemi brigadiers, Vidyunmali and Mayashrenik, sat a distance away. A muscular and once \\nproud man stood in front of Shiva, his hands together, pleading. \\n\\n‘Give me a chance, my Lord,’said Drapaku. ‘If the law has been changed, then why can’t we \\nfight?’ \\n\\nDrapaku was the man whose blind father had blessed Shiva in Kotdwaar. He had been a \\nbrigadier in the Meluhan army before the disease which blinded his father also killed his wife and \\nunborn child. He had been declared a vikarma along with his father. \\n\\n‘First, how is your father?’asked Shiva. ‘He is well, my Lord. And he will disown me if I don’t \\nsupport you in this dharmayudh.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled softly. He too believed this was a dharmayudh, a holy war. ‘But Drapaku, who will \\ntake care of him if something were to happen to you?’ \\n\\n‘Meluha will take care of him, my Lord. But he would die a thousand deaths if I didn’t go to \\nbatde with you. What kind of a son would I be if I didn’t fight for my father’s honour? For my \\ncountry’s honour?’ \\n\\nShiva still seemed a litde unsure. He could sense the discomfort of the others in the room with \\nthis conversation. It had not escaped his notice that despite the repeal of the vikarma law, nobody \\nhad touched Drapaku when he had entered. \\n\\n‘My Lord, we are outnumbered heavily by the Chandravanshis,’continued Drapaku. ‘We need \\nevery trained warrior we have. There are at least five thousand soldiers who can’t battle since \\nthey had been declared vikarma. I can bring them together. We are willing, and eager, to die for \\nour country ’ \\n\\n‘I don’t want you to die for Meluha, brave Drapaku,’said Shiva. Drapaku’s face fell instantly. \\nHe thought he would be returning home to Kotdwaar. ‘However,’continued Shiva. ‘I would like it \\nif you killed for Meluha.’ \\n\\nDrapaku looted up. \\n\\n‘Raise your brigade, Drapaku,’ordered Shiva. Turning towards Daksha, he continued, ‘We will \\ncall it the Vikarma Brigade.’ \\n\\n\\n— A®m - \\n\\n‘How can we have vikarmas in our army? This is ridiculous! ’ glared Vidyunmali. \\n\\nVidyunmali and Mayashrenik were in their private gym, preparing for their regular sword \\ntraining. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Vidyu...,’ cajoled Mayashrenik \\n\\n‘Don’t “Vidyu”ms, Maya. You know this is wrong.’ \\n\\nThe usually calm Mayashrenikjust nodded and let his impetuous friend vent his frustration. \\n‘How will I face my ancestors if I die in this battle?’asked Vidyunmali. ‘What will I answer if \\nthey ask me how I let a non-Kshatriya fight a battle that only we Kshatriyas should have fought? \\nIt is our duty to protect the weak. We are not supposed to use the weak to fight for us.’ \\n\\n‘Vidyu, I don’t think Drapaku is weak Have you forgotten his valour in the previous \\nChandra vanshi war?’ \\n\\n‘He is a vikarma! That makes him weak! ’ \\n\\n‘Lord Shiva has ordered that there are no vikarmas anymore.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t think the Neelkanfh truly knows right from wrong! ’ \\n\\n‘VIDYU! ’ shouted Mayashrenik \\nVidyunmali was surprised by the outburst. \\n\\n‘If the Neelkanth says it is right,’ continued Mayashrenik, ‘then it is right! ’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22 \\n\\n\\nEmpire of Evil \\n\\n‘This is the military formation I think ideal for the battle,’ said Parvateshwar. \\n\\nVraka and Parvateshwar were sitting in the general’s private office. The formation was that of \\na bow. The soldiers would be arranged in a wide semi-circular pattern. The slower corps, like the \\ntortoises, would be placed at the centre. The flanks would comprise quieter units such as the light \\ninfantry. The cavalry would be at both the ends of the bow, ready to be quickly deployed \\nanywhere on the front or to ride along the sides of the bow for protection. The bow formation was \\nideal for a smaller army. It provided flexibility without sacrificing strength. \\n\\n‘It is ideal, my Lord,’ said Vraka. ‘What does the Mahadev have to say?’ \\n\\n‘Shiva thinks it suits our requirements perfectly ’ \\n\\nVraka did not like it when Parvateshwar referred to the Neelkanth by his name. But who was he \\nto correct his general? ‘I agree, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘I will lead the left flank,’said Parvateshwar. ‘And you will lead the right. That is why I need \\nyour opinion on some things.’ \\n\\n‘Me, my Lord?’ asked an astonished Vraka. ‘I thought the Mahadev would lead the other flank’ \\n\\n‘Shiva? No, I don’t think he would be fighting this war, Vraka.’ \\n\\nVraka looted up in surprise. But he remained silent. \\n\\nParvateshwar probably felt the need to explain, for he continued speaking. ‘He is a good and \\ncapable man, no doubt. But the uppermost desire in his mind is retribution, not justice for Meluha. \\nWe will help him wreak vengeance when we throw the guilty Naga at his feet. He won’t be \\nputting his own life at risk in a war just to find one Naga.’ \\n\\nVraka kept his eyes low, lest they betray the fact that he disagreed with his chief. \\n\\n‘To be fair,’said Parvateshwar. ‘We can’t impose on him just because he has a blue throat. I \\nrespect him a lot. But I don’t expect him to fight. What reason would there be for him to do that?’ \\n\\nVraka looted up for a brief instant at Parvateshwar’s eyes. Why was his general refusing to \\naccept what was so obvious to everyone? Was he so attached to Lord Ram that he couldn’t \\nbelieve that another saviour had arrived on earth? Did he actually believe that Lord Ram could be \\nthe only one? Hadn’t Lord Ram himself said that he is replaceable, only dharma is irreplaceable? \\n\\n‘Furthermore,’continued Parvateshwar, ‘he is married now. He is obviously in love. He is not \\ngoing to riskSati being bereaved again. Why should he? It’s unfair of us to demand this of him.’ \\n\\n‘Vraka thought, not daring to voice his opinion. The Mahadev will fight for all of us, General. He \\nwill battle to protect us. Why? Because that is what Mahadev s do. ’ \\n\\n\\n\\nVraka was not aware that Parvateshwar was hoping something similar in his mind. He too \\nwished that Shiva would rise to be a Mahadev and lead them to victory against the \\nChandravanshis. However, Parvateshwar had learned through long years of experience that \\nwhile many men tried to rise up to Lord Ram’s level, none had ever succeeded. Parvateshwar \\nhad laid hopes on a few such men in his youth. And he had always been disillusioned at the end. \\nHe was simply preparing himself for another such expected disappointment from Shiva. He \\ndidn’t plan to be left without a backup if Shiva refused to fight the battle against the \\nChandra vanshis. \\n\\n\\n— Adm® — \\n\\nThe war council sat silently as Daksha read the letter that had come back from Swadweep — \\nfrom the court of Emperor Dilipa. Daksha’s reaction upon reading the letter left no doubt as to the \\nmessage it contained. He shut his eyes, his face contorted in rage, his fist clenched tight. He \\nhanded the letter over to Kanakhala and sneered, ‘Read it. Read it out loud so that the whole world \\nmay be sickened by the repugnance of the Chandra vanshis.’ \\n\\nKanakhala frowned slightly before taking the letter and reading it out loud. ‘Emperor Daksha, \\nSuryavanshi liege, protector of Meluha. Please accept my deep condolences for the dastardly \\nattack on Mount Mandar. Such a senseless assault on peaceful Brahmins cannot but be \\ncondemned in the strongest of terms. We are shocked that any denizen of India would stoop to \\nsuch levels. It is, therefore, with surprise and sadness that I read your letter. I assure you that \\nneither me nor anyone in my command has anything to do with this devious attack. Hence I have \\nto inform you, with regret, that there is nobody I can hand over to you. I hope that you \\nunderstand the sincerity of this letter and will not make a hasty decision, which may have \\nregrettable consequences for you. I assure you of my empire’s full support in the investigation of \\nthis outrage. Please do inform us of how we can be of assistance to you in bringing the criminals \\nto justice.’ \\n\\nKanakhala took a deep breath to compose herself. The anger over the typically Chandra vanshi \\ndoubletalk was washing right through her, making her regret her earlier stand. \\n\\n‘It’s personally signed by the Emperor Dilipa,’said Kanakhala, completing her reading of the \\nletter. \\n\\n‘Not Emperor Dilipa,’ growled a fuming Daksha. ‘Terrorist Dilipa of the Empire of Evil! ’ \\n\\n‘War! ’ arose a cry from the council, unanimous in its rage. \\n\\nDaksha looked over at a scowling Shiva who nodded imperceptibly. \\n\\n‘War it is! ’ bellowed Daksha. ‘We march in two weeks! ’ \\n\\n\\n\\n— *®m — \\n\\nThe bracelet seemed to develop a life of its own. It had swelled to enormous proportions, \\ndwarfing Shiva. Its edges were engulfed in gigantic flames. The three colossal serpents, which \\nformed the Aum, separated from each other and slithered towards Shiva. The one in the centre, \\nwhile nodding to the snake on its left, hissed, ‘He got your brother. And the other one will soon get \\nyour wife.’ \\n\\nThe serpents to the left and right scowled eerily. \\n\\nShiva pointed his finger menacingly at the serpent in the centre. ‘You dare touch even a hair on \\nher and I will rip your soul out of...’ \\n\\n‘But I...’continued the serpent, not even acknowledging Shiva’s threat. ‘I’m saving myself. I’m \\nsaving myself for you.’ \\n\\nShiva stared at the serpent with impotent rage. \\n\\n‘I will get you,’ said the serpent as its mouth opened wide, ready to swallow him whole. \\n\\nShiva’s eyes suddenly opened wide. He was sweating hard. He looted around, but couldn’t see \\na thing. It was extraordinarily dark. He reached out for Sati, to check if she was safe. She wasn’t \\nthere. He was up in a flash, feeling a chill in his heart, almost expecting that the serpents had \\nescaped his dreams and transformed into reality. \\n\\n‘Shiva,’ said Sati, looking at him. \\n\\nShe was sitting at the edge of the bed. The tiny military tent they slept in could not afford the \\nluxury of chairs. This tent had been their travelling home for the last one month as the Meluhan \\narmy marched towards Swadweep. \\n\\n‘What is it, Sati?’asked Shiva, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. He slipped the offending \\nbracelet that he held tightly in his hands, back into his pouch. \\n\\nWhen had I taken it out? \\n\\n‘Shiva,’continued Sati. She had tried to talkabout this for the last two weeks. Ever since she had \\nbeen sure of the news, but had never found an opportune moment. She always managed to \\nconvince herself that this was minor news and it would not be right for her to trouble her husband \\nwith this, especially when he was going through one of the worst phases of his life. But it was too \\nlate now. He had to learn from her and not somebody else. News like this did not remain secret in \\nan army camp for long. ‘I have something to tell you.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Shiva, though his dream still rankled. ‘What is it?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t think I will be able to fight in the war.’ \\n\\n‘What? Why?’asked a startled Shiva. He knew that cowardice was a word that did not exist in \\nSati’s dictionary. Then why was she telling him so? And why now, when the army had already \\nmarched for nearly a month through the dense forests that separated Meluha from Swadweep? \\nThey were already in enemy territory. There was no turning back ‘Sati, this is not like you.’ \\n\\n‘Umm, Shiva,’ said an embarrassed Sati. Such discussions were always difficult for the \\nsomewhat prudish Sury avanshis. ‘I have my reasons.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Reasons?’ asked Shiva. ‘What...’ \\n\\nSuddenly the reason smacked Shiva like a silent thunderbolt. \\n\\n‘My god! Are you sure?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Sati, bashfully. \\n\\n‘By the Holy Lake! I am going to be a father?’ \\n\\nSeeing the ecstasy on Shiva’s face, Sati felt a pang of guilt that she hadn’t told him before. \\n\\n‘Wow!’whooped a thrilled Shiva as he swirled her in his arms. ‘This is the best news I have \\nheard in a long time!’ \\n\\nSati smiled warmly and rested her head on his tired but strong shoulders. \\n\\n‘We will name our daughter after the one who has comforted you through the last two months, \\nwhen I have been of no help,’ said Shiva. ‘We will name her Krittika! ’ \\n\\nSati looked up in surprise. She didn’t believe that it was possible to love him even more. But it \\nwas. She smiled. ‘It could be a son, you know’ \\n\\n‘Nah,’ grinned Shiva. ‘It will be a daughter. And I’ll spoil her to high heavens! ’ \\n\\nSati laughed heartily. Shiva joined in. His first spirited laugh in over two months. He embraced \\nSati, feeling the negative energy dissipate from his being. ‘I love you, Sati.’ \\n\\n‘I love you too,’ she whispered. \\n\\n\\n— - \\n\\nShiva raised the curtain to come out of the tent that Sati was ensconced in. Krittika and Ay urvati \\nwere with her. A retinue of nurses attended to her every need. Shiva had been obsessive about the \\nhealth of his unborn child, questioning Ay urvati incessantly about every aspect of Sati’s well¬ \\nbeing for the last two months of the march to Swadweep. \\n\\nThe Suryavanshis had moved valiantly for nearly three months. The path had been much \\nmore challenging than expected. The forest had reclaimed its original habitat with alarming \\nferocity. The army was invaded by wild animals and disease at every turn. They had lost two \\nthousand men. And not one to the enemy. After weeks of hacking and marching, the scouts had \\nfinally managed to lead the Suryavanshi army to the Chandravanshis. \\n\\nThe Chandravanshis were camped on a sweeping plain called Dharmakhet. Their choice was \\nclever. A substantial and uncluttered field, it had enough room to allow the Chandravanshis to \\nmanoeuvre their million strong army. The full weight of their numerical superiority would come \\ninto play. The Suryavanshi army had tried to wait out the Chandravanshis, to test if they would \\nlose patience and attack in a less advantageous area. But the Chandravanshis had held firm. \\nFinally, the Suryavanshis moved camp to an easily defensible valley close to Dharmakhet. \\n\\nShiva looted up at the clear sky. A lone eagle flew overhead, circling the royal camp, while \\nfive pigeons flew lower, unafraid of the eagle. A strange sign. His Guna shaman would have \\nprobably said that it’s a bad time for batde, for the pigeons clearly have a hidden advantage. \\n\\nDon’t thinkabout it. It is all nonsense in any case. \\n\\n\\n\\nBreathing in the fresh morning air deeply, he turned right, towards Emperor Daksha’s tent. \\nNandi was walking towards him. \\n\\n‘What is it Nandi?’ \\n\\n‘I was just coming towards your tent, my Lord. The Emperor requests your presence. There’s \\nbeen a troubling development’ \\n\\nShiva and Nandi hurried towards Daksha’s tastefully appointed royal tent. They entered to find \\nDaksha and Parvateshwar engrossed in a discussion. Vraka, Mayashrenik and Drapaku sat at a \\ndistance. Drapaku was a little further away from the rest. \\n\\n‘This is a disaster,’ groaned Daksha. \\n\\n‘Your Highness?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘My Lord! I’m glad you’re here. We face complete disaster.’ \\n\\n‘Let’s not use words like that, your Highness,’said Shiva. Turning towards Parvateshwar, he \\nasked, ‘So your suspicions were correct?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’said Parvateshwar. ‘The scouts just returned a few minutes ago. There was a reason the \\nChandravanshis were refusing to mobilise. They have despatched a hundred thousand soldiers in \\na great arc around our position. They will enter our valley by tomorrow morning. We will be \\nsandwiched between their main force ahead of us and another hundred thousand at the back’ \\n\\n‘We can’t fight on two fronts, my Lord,’ cried Daksha. \\n\\n‘What do we do?’ \\n\\n‘Was it Veerbhadra’s scouts who returned with the news?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\nParvateshwar nodded. Shiva turned towards Nandi, who rushed out immediately. Moments \\nlater, Veerbhadra stood before them. \\n\\n‘What route is the Chandravanshi detachment taking, Bhadra?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Up the east, along the steep mountains on our side. I think they intend to enter our valley some \\nfifty kilometres up north.’ \\n\\n‘Did you take a cartographer with you as Parvateshwar had instructed?’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra nodded, moved to the centre table and laid out the map on it. Shiva and \\nParvateshwar leaned across. Pointing to the route with his fingers, Veerbhadra said, ‘This way’. \\n\\nShiva suddenly started as he noticed the ideal defensive position on the map, deep north of the \\nSuryavanshi camp. He looted up at Parvateshwar. The same thought had occurred to the \\nGeneral. \\n\\n‘How many men do you think, Parvateshwar?’ \\n\\n‘Difficult to say. It will be tough. But the pass looks defendable. It will need a sizeable \\ncontingent though. At least thirty thousand.’ \\n\\n‘But we can’t spare too many men. I am sure the battle with the main Chandravanshi army to \\nthe south will also happen tomorrow. It would be the best time for them to take up positions.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar nodded grimly. The Meluhans might just have to retreat and manoeuvre for a \\nbatde on another, more advantageous position, he thought unhappily. \\n\\n‘I think five thousand men ought to do it, my Lords.’ \\n\\nShiva and Parvateshwar had not noticed Drapaku move to the table. He was examining the pass \\nthat Shiva had just pointed out. \\n\\n‘Lookhere,’ continued Drapaku, as Shiva and Parvateshwar peered. \\n\\n‘The mountains ahead constrict rapidly to this pass, which is not more than fifty metres across. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter how big their army is, each charge by the enemy into the pass cannot comprise \\nof more than a few hundred men.’ \\n\\n‘But Drapaku, with a hundred thousand men, they can launch one charge after another, almost \\ncontinuously,’said Mayashrenik ‘And with the mountains so steep on the sides, you can’t use any \\nof our missiles. Victory is almost impossible.’ \\n\\n‘It’s not about victory,’said Drapaku. ‘It’s about holding them for a day so that our main army \\ncan fight.’ \\n\\n‘I will do it,’ said Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘No, my Lord,’ said Vraka. ‘You are required for the main charge.’ Shiva looted up at \\nParvateshwar. \\n\\nI need to be here as well. \\n\\n‘I can’t do it either,’ said Shiva, shaking his head. \\n\\nParvateshwar looted up at Shiva, disillusionment writ large on his face. While he had prepared \\nhis heart for disappointment, he had hoped that Shiva would prove him wrong. But it appeared \\nclear to Parvateshwar that Shiva too would be simply watching the battie from the viewing \\nplatform being made for Daksha. \\n\\n‘Give me the honour, my Lord,’ said Drapaku. \\n\\n‘Drapaku...,’ whispered Mayashrenik, not putting in words what everyone else knew. \\n\\nWith only five thousand soldiers, the battle at the northern pass against the Chandravanshi \\ndetachment was a suicide mission. \\n\\n‘Drapaku,’ said Shiva. ‘I don’t know if...’ \\n\\n‘I know, my Lord,’interrupted Drapaku. ‘It is my destiny. I will hold them for one day. If Lord \\nIndra supports me, I’ll even try for two. Get us victory by then.’ \\n\\nDaksha suddenly interjected. ‘Wonderful. Drapaku, mate preparations to leave immediately’ \\n\\nDrapaku saluted smartly and rushed out before any second thoughts were voiced. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt took less than an hour before the vikarma brigade was marching out of the camp. The sun \\nwas high up in the sky and practically the entire camp was awake, watching the soldiers set out on \\ntheir mission. Everyone knew the terrible odds the vikarmas were going to face. They knew that it \\nwas unlikely that any of these soldiers would be seen alive again. The soldiers, though, did not \\nexhibit the slightest hesitation or hint of fear, as they waited on. The camp stood in silent awe. \\nOne thought reverberated through all of them. \\n\\nHow could the vikarmas be so magnificent? They are supposed to be weak. \\n\\nDrapaku was at the lead, his handsome face smeared with war paint. On top of his armour, he \\nwore a saffron angvastram. The colour of the Parmatma. The colour worn for the final journey. \\nHe didn’t expect to return. \\n\\nHe stopped suddenly as Vidyunmali darted in front of him. Drapaku frowned. Before he could \\n\\n\\n\\nreact, Vidyunmali had drawn his knife. Drapaku reached for his side arm. But Vidyunmali was \\nquicker. He sliced his own thumb across the blade, and brought it up to Drapaku’s forehead. In the \\ntradition of the great brother-warriors of yore, Vidyunmali ran his blood across Drapaku’s brow, \\nsignifying that his blood will protect him. \\n\\n‘You’re a better man than me, Drapaku,’ whispered Vidyunmali. \\n\\nDrapaku stood silent, astonished by Vidyunmali’s uncharacteristic behaviour. \\n\\nRaising his balled fist high, Vidyunmali roared, ‘Give them hell, vikarma! ’ \\n\\n‘Give them hell, vikarma!’ bellowed the Suryavanshis, repeating it again and again. \\n\\nDrapaku and his soldiers looked around the camp, absorbing the respect that they had been \\ndenied so long. Way too long. \\n\\n‘Give them hell, vikarma!’ \\n\\nDrapaku nodded, turned and marched on before his emotions spoiled the moment. His soldiers \\nfollowed. \\n\\n‘Give them hell, vikarma!’ \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt was an uncharacteristically warm morning for that time of the year. \\n\\nThe Chandravanshi detachment had been surprised to find Meluhan soldiers at the northern \\npass the previous night. They had immediately attacked. The vikarmas had held them through the \\nnight, buying precious time for the main Suryavanshi army. This had to be the day for the main \\nbattle. Shiva was prepared. \\n\\nSati stood resplendent, looping the aarti thali in small circles around Shiva’s face. She stopped \\nafter seven turns, tooksome vermilion on her thumb and smeared it up Shiva’s forehead in a long \\ntilak ‘Come back victorious or don’t come backat all.’ \\n\\nShiva raised one eyebrow and grimaced. ‘What kind of a send off is that?! ’ \\n\\n‘What? No, it’s just...’ stammered Sati. \\n\\n‘I know, I know,’smiled Shiva as he embraced Sati. ‘It’s the traditional Suryavanshi send off \\nbefore a war, right?’ \\n\\nSati looted up, her eyes moist. Her love for Shiva was overcoming decades of Suryavanshi \\ntraining. ‘Just come backsafe and sound.’ \\n\\n‘I will, my love,’ whispered Shiva. ‘You won’t get rid of me that easily.’ \\n\\nSati smiled weakly. ‘I’ll be waiting.’ \\n\\nSati stood on her toes and kissed Shiva lightly. Shiva kissed her back and turned quickly, before \\nhis heart would overcome his head with second thoughts. Lifting the tent curtain, he waited out. \\nHe looted up at the skies, in case there were some other omens. There were none. \\n\\nBloody good! \\n\\nThe distant droning of Sanskrit shlokas, accompanied by the beating of war drums in a smooth \\nrhythmic pulse, wafted in over the dry winter breeze. Shiva had thought this particular \\n\\n\\n\\nSuryavanshi custom odd. But maybe there was something to the Brahmin ‘Call for Indra and \\nAgni’, as this particular puja was called. The drums and the shlokas somehow grafted together to \\nrouse a fierce warrior spirit in whoever heard them. The beats would quieten as the battle began. \\nShiva was eager to throw himself into the battle. He turned and strode towards Daksha’s tent. \\n\\n‘Greetings, your Highness,’said Shiva as he raised the curtain to enter the royal tent, where \\nParvateshwar was explaining the plans to the Emperor. ‘Namaste, Parvateshwar.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar smiled and folded his hands. \\n\\n‘What news of Drapaku, Parvateshwar?’asked Shiva. The last despatch I heard is at least three \\nhours old.’ \\n\\n‘The vikarma battle is on. Drapaku still leads them. He has bought us invaluable time. May Lord \\nRam bless him.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ agreed Shiva. ‘May Lord Ram bless him. He just has to hold on to the end of this day.’ \\n\\n‘My Lord,’said Daksha, hands in a formal namaste, head bowed. ‘It is an auspicious beginning. \\nWe will have a good day. Wouldn’t you agree?’ \\n\\n‘Yes it does seem so,’smiled Shiva. The news of Drapaku is very welcome. ‘But perhaps this \\nquestion may be better suited for the fourth prahar, your Highness.’ \\n\\n‘I am sure the answer would be the same, my Lord. By the fourth prahar today, Emperor \\nDilipa will be standing in front of us, in chains, waiting for justice to be done.’ \\n\\n‘Careful, your Highness,’ said Shiva with a smile. ‘Let us not tempt fate. We still have to win the \\nwar!’ \\n\\n‘We will face no problems. We have the Neelkanfh with us. We just need to attack. Victory is \\nguaranteed.’ \\n\\n‘I think a litde bit more than a blue throat will be required to beat the Chandravanshis, your \\nHighness,’ said Shiva, his smile even broader. ‘We shouldn’t underestimate our enemy.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t underestimate them, my Lord. But I will not mate the mistake of underestimating you \\neither.’ \\n\\nShiva gave up. He had learned some time back that it was impossible to win a debate against \\nDaksha’s unquestioning conviction. \\n\\n‘Perhaps I should leave, your Highness,’said Parvateshwar. The time has come. With your \\npermission.’ \\n\\n‘Of course, Parvateshwar. Vijayibhavl\\' said Daksha. Turning towards Shiva, Daksha continued, \\n‘My Lord, they have built a viewing platform for us on the hill at the back’ \\n\\n‘Viewing platform?’ asked Shiva, perplexed. \\n\\n‘Yes. Why don’t we watch the battle from there? You would also be in a better position to direct \\nthe battle from there.’ \\n\\nShiva narrowed his eyes in surprise. ‘Your Highness, my position is with the soldiers. On the \\nbattlefield.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar stopped in his tracks. Startled and delighted at having been proved wrong. \\n\\n‘My Lord, this is a job for butchers, not the Neelkanfh,’said a concerned Daksha. ‘You don’t \\nneed to sully your hands with Chandravanshi blood. Parvateshwar will arrest that Naga and throw \\nhim at your feet. You can extract such a terrible retribution from him that his entire tribe would \\ndread your justice for aeons.’ \\n\\n‘This is not about my revenge, your Highness. It is about the vengeance of Meluha. It would be \\n\\n\\n\\npetty of me to think that an entire war is being fought just for me. This is a war between good and \\nevil. A batde in which one has to choose a side. And fight. There are no bystanders in a \\ndharmayudh — it is a holy war.\\' \\n\\nParvateshwar watched Shiva intently, his eyes blazing with admiration. These were Lord \\nRam’s words. There are no bystanders in a dharmayudh. \\n\\n‘My Lord, we can’t afford to riskyour life/pleaded Daksha. You are too important. I am sure \\nthat we can win this war without taking that gamble. Your presence has inspired us. There are \\nmany who are willing to shed their blood for you.’ \\n\\n‘If they are willing to shed their blood for me, then I must be willing to shed my blood for \\nthem.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar’s heart was swamped by the greatest joy an accomplished Suryavanshi could \\nfeel. The joy of finally finding a man worth following. The joy of finding a man worth being \\ninspired by. The joy of finding a man, deserving of being spoken of in the same breath, as Lord \\nRam himself. \\n\\nA worried Daksha came closer to Shiva. He realised that if he had to stop the Neelkanth from \\nthis foolhardiness, he would have to speak his mind. He whispered softly, ‘My Lord, you are my \\ndaughter’s husband. If something happened to you, she would be bereaved twice in one life. I \\ncan’t let that happen to her.’ \\n\\n‘Nothing will happen,’whispered Shiva. ‘And Sati would die a thousand deaths if she saw her \\nhusband stay away from a dharmayudh. She would lose respect for me. If she weren’t pregnant, \\nshe would have been fighting alongside me, shoulder to shoulder. You know that.’ \\n\\nDaksha stared at Shiva, broken, troubled and apprehensive. \\n\\nShiva smiled warmly. ‘Nothing will happen, your Highness.’ \\n\\n‘And what if it does?’ \\n\\n‘Then it should be remembered that it happened for a good cause. Sati would be proud of me.’ \\n\\nDaksha continued to stare at Shiva, his face a portrait of agonised distress. \\n\\n‘Forgive me, your Highness, but I must go,’ said Shiva with a formal namaste, turning to leave. \\n\\nParvateshwar followed distracted, as if commanded by a higher force. As Shiva walked briskly \\nout of the tent towards his horse, he heard Parvateshwar’s booming voice. ‘My Lord! ’ \\n\\nShiva continued walking. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ bellowed Parvateshwar again, more insistent. \\n\\nShiva stopped abruptly. He turned, a surprised frown on his face. ‘I am sorry Parvateshwar. I \\nthought you were calling out to his Highness.’ \\n\\n‘No, my Lord,’ said Parvateshwar, reaching up to Shiva. ‘It was you I called.’ \\n\\nHis frown deeper, Shiva asked, ‘What is the matter, brave General?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar came to a halt in rigid military attention. He kept a polite distance from Shiva. \\nHe could not stand on the hallowed ground that cradled the Mahadev. As if in a daze, \\nParvateshwar slowly curled his fist and brought it up to his chest. And then, completing the formal \\nMeluhan salute, he bowed low. Lower than he had ever bowed before a living man. As low as he \\nbowed before Lord Ram’s idol during his regular morning pujas. Shiva continued to stare at \\nParvateshwar, his face an odd mixture of surprise and embarrassment. Shiva respected \\nParvateshwar too much to be comfortable with such open idolisation from him. \\n\\nRising, but with his head still bent, Parvateshwar whispered, ‘I will be honoured to shed my \\n\\n\\n\\nblood with you, my Lord.’ Raising his head, he repeated, ‘Honoured.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled and touched Parvateshwar’s arm. ‘Well, if our plans are good my friend, \\nhopefully we won’t have to shed too much of it! ’ \\n\\n\\n\\n$ \\n\\nCHAPTER 23 \\n\\nDharmayudh, the Holy War \\n\\nThe Suryavanshis were arranged like a bow. Strong, yet flexible. The recently raised tortoise \\nregiments had been placed at the centre. The light infantry formed the flanks, while the cavalry, \\nin turn, bordered them. The chariots had been abandoned due to the unseasonal rain the previous \\nnight. They couldn’t risk the wheels getting stuck in the slush. The newly reared archer regiments \\nremained stationed at the back Skilfully designed backrests had been fabricated for them, which \\nallowed the archers to lie and guide their feet with an ingenious system of gears. The bows could \\nbe stretched across their feet and the strings drawn back up to their chins, releasing powerfully \\nbuilt arrows, almost the size of small spears. As they were at the back of the Suryavanshi \\ninfantry, their presence was hidden from the Chandravanshis. \\n\\nThe Chandravanshis had placed their army as per their strength in a standard offensive \\nformation. Their massive infantry was in squads of five thousand. There were fifty such, \\ncomprising a full legion in a straight line. They stretched as far as the eye could see. There were \\nthree more such legions behind the first one, ready to finish off the job. This formation allowed a \\ndirect assault onto a numerically inferior enemy, giving the offence tremendous strength and \\nsolidity, but also making it rigid. The squads left spaces in between them, to allow the cavalry to \\ncharge through if required. Seeing the Suryavanshi formation, the Chandravanshi cavalry from \\nthe rear had been moved to the flanks. This would enable a quieter charge at the flanks of the \\nSuryavanshi formation and disrupt enemy lines. The Chandravanshi general clearly had a copy \\nof the ancient war manuals and was playing it religiously, page by page. It would have been a \\nperfect move against an enemy who also followed standard tactics. Unfortunately, he was up \\nagainst a Tibetan tribal chief whose innovations had transformed the Suryavanshi attack \\nAs Shiva rode towards the hillockat the edge of the main battlefield, the Brahmins picked up the \\ntempo of their shlokas while the war drums pumped the energy to a higher level. Despite being \\noutnumbered on a vast scale, the Suryavanshis did not exhibit even the slightest hint of \\nnervousness. They had buried their fear deep. \\n\\nThe war cries of the clan-gods of the various brigades rent the air. \\n\\n‘Indra dev Id jail’ \\n\\n‘Agni dev Id jail’ \\n\\n‘Jai Shakti devi Id! ’ \\n\\n‘Varun dev ki jai!’ \\n\\n‘Jai Pawan dev Id!’ \\n\\n\\n\\nBut these cries were forgotten in an instant as the soldiers saw a magnificent white steed canter \\nin over the hillock carrying a handsome, muscular figure. A thunderous roar pierced the sky, loud \\nenough to force the gods out of their cloud palaces to peer at the events unfolding below. The \\nNeelkanth raised his hand in acknowledgment. Following him was General Parvateshwar, \\naccompanied by Nandi and Veerbhadra. \\n\\nVraka was off his horse in a flash as Shiva approached him. Parvateshwar dismounted equally \\nrapidly and was next to Vraka before Shiva could reach him. \\n\\n‘The Lord will lead the right flank, Brigadier,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘I hope that is alright’ \\n\\n‘It will be my honour to fight under his command, my Lord,’ said a beaming Vraka. He \\nimmediately pulled out his Field Commander baton from the grip on his side, went down on one \\nknee and raised his hand high, to handover the charge to Shiva. \\n\\n‘You people have to stop doing this,’ said Shiva laughing. ‘You embarrass me! ’ \\n\\nPulling Vraka up on his feet, Shiva embraced him tightly. ‘I am your friend, not your Lord.’ \\n\\nA stardled Vraka stepped back his soul unable to handle the gush of positive energy flowing in. \\nHe mumbled, ‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\nShaking his head softly, Shiva smiled. He gently took the baton from Vraka’s extended hand and \\nraised it high, for the entire Suryavanshi army to see. An ear-splitting cry ripped through the \\nranks. \\n\\n‘Mahadev! Mahadev! Mahadev!’ \\n\\nShiva vaulted onto his horse in one smooth arc. Holding the baton high, he rode up and down the \\nline. The Suryavanshi roar got louder and louder. \\n\\n‘Mahadev! ’ \\n\\n‘Mahadev! ’ \\n\\n‘Mahadev! ’ \\n\\n‘Suryavanshis!’bellowed Shiva, raising his hand. ‘Meluhans! Hear me!’ \\n\\nThe army quietened down to hear their living god. \\n\\n‘Who is a Mahadev?’ roared Shiva. \\n\\nThey listened in rapt attention, hanging on his every word. \\n\\n‘Does he sit on a sad height and look on idly while ordinary men do what should be his job? \\nNo!’ \\n\\nSome soldiers were praying inaudibly. \\n\\n‘Does he just lazily bestow his blessings while others fight for the good? Does he stand by \\nnonchalantly and count the dead while the living sacrifice themselves to destroy evil? No!’ \\n\\nThere was pin-drop silence as the Suryavanshis absorbed their Neelkanth’s message. \\n\\n‘A man becomes a Mahadev only when he fights for good. A Mahadev is not born from his \\nmother’s womb. He is forged in the heat of battle, when he wages a war to destroy evil!’ \\n\\nThe army stood hushed, feeling a flood of positive energy. \\n\\n‘I am a Mahadev! ’ bellowed Shiva. \\n\\nA resounding roar arose from the Suryavanshis. They were led by the Mahadev. The God oj \\nGods. The Chandravanshis did not stand a chance. \\n\\n‘But I am not the only one! ’ \\n\\nA shocked silence descended on the Suryavanshis. What did the Mahadev mean? He is not the \\nonly one? Do the Chandravanshis have a god too? \\n\\n\\n\\n‘I am not the only one! For I see a hundred thousand Mahadevs in front of me! I see a hundred \\nthousand men willing to fight on the side of good! I see a hundred thousand men willing to battle \\nevil! I see a hundred thousand men capable of destroying evil! ’ \\n\\nThe stunned Suryavanshis gaped at their Neelkanth as the import of his words permeated their \\nminds. They dared notaskthe question: Are we gods? \\n\\nShiva had the answer: ‘HarEk Hal Mahadev! ’ \\n\\nThe Meluhans stood astounded. Every single one a Mahadev? \\n\\n‘Har Har Mahadev?\\' bellowed Shiva. \\n\\nThe Meluhans roared. All of us are Mahadevs! \\n\\nPure primal energy coursed through the veins of each Suryavanshi. They were gods! It didn’t \\nmatter that the Chandravanshis outnumbered them ten to one. They were gods! Even if the evil \\nChandravanshis outnumbered them a hundred to one, victory was assured. They were gods! \\n\\n‘Har Har Mahadev! ’ cried the Suryavanshi army. \\n\\n‘Har Har Mahadev! ’ yelled Shiva. ‘All of us are gods! Gods on a mission! ’ \\n\\nDrawing his sword, he pulled the reins of his horse. Rising on its hind legs with a ferocious \\nneigh, the horse pirouetted smartly to face the Chandravanshis. Shiva pointed his sword at his \\nenemies. ‘On a mission to destroy evil!’ \\n\\nThe Suryavanshis bellowed after their Lord. Har Har Mahadev! \\n\\nThe cry rent the air. Har Har Mahadev! \\n\\nVictory would not be denied. Har Har Mahadev! \\n\\nThe long spell of evil would end today. Har Har Mahadev! \\n\\nAs the army roared like the gods that they were, Shiva rode on towards a beaming \\nParvateshwar who was flanked by Nandi, Veerbhadra and Vraka. \\n\\n‘Nice speech,’ grinned Veerbhadra. \\n\\nShiva winked at him. He then turned his horse towards Parvateshwar. ‘General, I think it’s time \\nwe start our own rainfall.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’nodded Parvateshwar. Turning his horse around, he gave the orders to his flag \\nbearer. ‘The archers.’ \\n\\nThe flag bearer raised the coded flag. It was red with a vicious black lightening darned on it. \\nThe message was repeated by flag bearers across the lines. The Suryavanshi infantry \\nimmediately hunched down on its knees. Shiva, Parvateshwar, Vraka, Nandi and Veerbhadra \\ndismounted rapidly, pulling their horses down to their knees. And the arrows flew in a deadly \\nshower. \\n\\nThe archers had been placed in a semi-circular formation, to cover as wide a range of the \\nChandravanshi army as possible. Five thousand archers rained death on the Chandravanshis as the \\nsky turned blackwith a curtain of arrows. The hapless Swadweepans were easy prey in their tight \\nformations. The arrows, nearly as powerful as short spears, easily penetrated the leather and \\nwood shields of the irregular Chandravanshi soldiers. Only the regulars held metal shields. It had \\nbeen just a few minutes of the ruthless massacre with arrows raining down onto the squads of the \\nfirst legion that the Chandravanshi lines started breaking. The first legion was taking too many \\ncasualties to hold on to their position. The irregulars started running back, causing chaos. \\nConfusion reigned in the legions behind. \\n\\nParvateshwar turned towards Shiva. ‘I think we should lengthen the range, my Lord.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nShiva nodded in reply. Parvateshwar nodded to his flag bearer who relayed the message. The \\narchers stopped shooting for just a few moments. Turning their wheels right, they rapidly raised \\nthe height of their foot rests. With the longer range quickly set, they drew their arrows. And let \\nfly. The arrows hit the second legion of the Chandravanshis now. The pincer attack of the \\nretreating first Chandravanshi legion and the concurrent hail of arrows created bedlam in the \\nsecond legion. \\n\\nShiva noticed the Chandravanshi cavalry moving into position to attack He turned to \\nParvateshwar. ‘General, their cavalry is moving out. They would aim to flank us and attack the \\narchers. Our cavalry needs to meet them midfield.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’said Parvateshwar. ‘I had expected this move from the Chandravanshis. That’s \\nwhy I had positioned two cavalries, comprising the Arishtanemi, led by Mayashrenik and \\nVidyunmali, on the flanks.’ \\n\\n‘Perfect! But General, our cavalry must not move too far ahead or our arrows will injure our \\nown men. Nor must they retreat. They have to hold their position. At least for another five \\nminutes.’ \\n\\n‘I agree. Our archers need that much time to finish their job.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar turned to his flag bearer with detailed instructions. Two couriers set off rapidly to \\nthe left and right. Within moments, the eastern and western Arishtanemi, led by Mayashrenik and \\nVidyunmali respectively, thundered out to meet the Chandravanshi counter-attack \\n\\nMeanwhile, the disarray in the second legion of the Chandravanshi army only increased as the \\nunrelenting and ruthless wall of arrows pounded down on them. The Suryavanshi archers, \\nunmindful of their tiring limbs or bleeding hands, bravely continued their unremitted assault. The \\nsecond legion line started breaking as the Chandravanshis tried desperately to escape the ruthless \\ncarnage. \\n\\n‘Higher range, my Lord?’ asked Parvateshwar, pre-empting Shiva’s words. Shiva nodded in \\nreply. \\n\\nMeanwhile the Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi cavalries were engaged in fierce combat on \\nthe eastern and western ends of the batdefield. The Chandravanshis knew they had to break \\nthrough. A few more minutes of the Suryavanshi archers’assault and the batde would be all but \\nlost. They fought desperately, like wounded tigers. Swords cut through flesh and bone. Spears \\npierced body armour. Soldiers, with limbs hanging half-severed, continued to battle away. \\nHorses, with their riders missing, attacked as if their own kves depended on it. The Chandravanshis \\nwere throwing all their might into breaking through the line that protected the archers. But to their \\nmisfortune, they had run into the fiercest brigadiers amongst the Sury avanshis. May ashrenikand \\nVidyunmali fought ferociously, holding the mammoth Chandravanshi force at bay. \\n\\nThe archers meanwhile had begun their onslaught on the third legion of the Chandravanshis. \\nTheir legions were bleeding to death or deserting in great numbers. Some of them, however, \\ngrimly and courageously, held on. When their shields were not strong enough to blockthe arrows, \\nthey used the bodies of their dead comrades. But they held the line. \\n\\n‘Do we stop now and charge, my Lord?’ asked Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘No. I want the third legion devastated as well. Let it go on for a few more minutes.’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord. We should also let half the archers raise their range a bit more. We can get the \\nweaker sections in the fourth legion as well. If their lines are also broken, confusion would rein \\n\\n\\n\\nright into the heart of their troops.’ \\n\\n‘You are right, Parvateshwar. Let’s do that.’ \\n\\nMeanwhile, the Chandravanshi cavalry on the western flank, sensing the hopelessness of their \\ncharge, began to retreat. Some Arishtanemi riders moved to give chase but Vidyunmali stopped \\nthem. As the Chandravanshis retreated, Vidyunmali ordered his troops to wait at their present \\npositions, lest the Chandravanshis launch a counter-attack. Seeing their enemy ride rapidly backto \\ntheir lines, Vidyunmali ordered a withdrawal to their initial position on the flank of the bow \\nformation. \\n\\nThe Chandravanshis facing Mayashrenik, however, were made of sterner stuff. Despite taking \\nsevere casualties, they fought grimly, refusing to retreat. Mayashrenik and his men fought \\nfiercely, holding their enemy. Suddenly, the hail of arrows stopped. The archers had been \\nordered to stand down. Now that their mission was accomplished without their intervention, the \\nChandravanshi brigadier ordered a retreat of his cavalry. Mayashrenik, in turn, withdrew his \\ntroops quickly to his earlier position to prepare for the main charge, which he knew was just a few \\nmoments away. \\n\\n‘General, shall we?’ asked Shiva, nodding towards the left flank \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ replied Parvateshwar. \\n\\nAs Parvateshwar turned to mount his horse, Shiva called out, ‘Parvateshwar?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘Race you to the last line of the Chandravanshis! ’ \\n\\nParvateshwar raised his eyebrows in surprise, smiling broadly. ‘I will win, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘We’ll see,’ grinned Shiva, his eyes narrowed in a playful challenge. \\n\\nParvateshwar rapidly mounted his horse and rode to his command on the left. Shiva, followed \\nby Vraka, Nandi and Veerbhadra rode to the right. Prasanjit geared his tortoise corps in the \\ncentre for the attack \\n\\n‘Meluhans!’roared Shiva, dismounting smoothly. ‘They lie in front of you! Waiting to be \\nslaughtered! It ends today! Evil ends today! ’ \\n\\n‘Har Har Mahadev!’ bellowed the soldiers as the Meluhan conch shell, announcing the \\nSuryavanshi attack, was blown. \\n\\nWith an ear-shattering yell, the infantry charged towards the Chandravanshis. The tortoise \\ncorps moved in their slow, yet unyielding pace towards the Chandravanshi centre. The sides of \\nthe bow formation moved quicker than the centre. The cavalry cantered along the flanks, \\nprotecting the infantry from an enemy charge. Courageous remnants of the third and fourth \\nlegions of the Chandravanshis meanwhile were rapidly reforming their lines to face the \\nSuryavanshi onslaught. But the mass of dead bodies of their fallen comrades did not allow them \\nthe space needed to form their traditional Chaturanga formation, which could have allowed some \\nlateral movement. They were huddled together in a tight but thin line before the Suryavanshis \\nwere upon them. \\n\\nThe battle was going almost exactly as per plan for the Suryavanshis. By the time they \\nreached the Chandravanshi line, they were in a tight, faintly curved line of trained and vicious \\nsoldiers, with their flanking line of light infantry being slightly behind the level of the slower \\nmoving tortoise corps at the centre. The unstoppable tortoise corps tore ruthlessly into the \\nChandravanshi centre. The shields provided protection for the corps against the best \\n\\n\\n\\nChandravanshi swordsmen, while their trishuls ripped through the Swadweepans. The \\nChandravanshis had but two choices. Either fall to the trishul, or be pushed towards the sides \\nwhere the Suryavanshis were now bearing down hard on them. As the centre of the \\nChandravanshi army broke under the unrelenting assault, the Suryavanshi flanks tore through their \\nsides. \\n\\nShiva was leading his flank ferociously into the Chandravanshis, decimating all in front of him. \\nTo his surprise, he found the enemy lines thinning. Letting his fellow soldiers charge ahead of \\nhim, he rose to his full height to observe the movements. He was shocked to see the \\nChandravanshi line opposing him, moving towards the centre. They were attacking the only \\nexposed flank of the tortoise corps, their right side, which could not be protected by shields. \\nSomeone in the Chandravanshi army was using his brains. If any of the tortoises broke, the \\nChandravanshis would swarm through the centre in a tight line, devastating the Suryavanshis. \\n\\n‘Meluhans!’ roared Shiva. ‘Follow me! ’ \\n\\nShiva’s flag bearer raised his pennant. The soldiers followed. The Neelkanth charged into the \\nsides of the Chandravanshi lines bearing down on the tortoises. Caught in a pincer attack between \\nthe trishuls and the charge from Shiva’s flank, the spirit of the Chandravanshis finally broke. \\n\\nWhat was a mighty Chandravanshi army was now reduced to independent stragglers fighting \\nvaliantly for a losing cause. Shiva and Parvateshwar led their respective sides to complete the \\njob. The victory was absolute. The Chandravanshi army had been comprehensively routed. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24 \\n\\n\\nA Stunning Revelation \\n\\nSati rushed out of her tent, followed by Krittika and Ayurvati. \\n\\n‘A little slowly, Sati,’ cried Ayurvati, running to keep up. ‘In your condition...’ \\n\\nSati turned and grinned back at Ayurvati, but did not reduce her pace. She sprinted to the royal \\ntent where she had been informed Shiva and Parvateshwar had reached after the declaration of \\nvictory. Nandi and Veerbhadra stood guard at the entrance. They moved aside to let Sati in, but \\nbarred Ayurvati and Krittika. \\n\\n‘I am sorry, Lady Ayurvati,’ said Nandi apologetically, his head bowed. ‘I have strict \\ninstructions not to let anybody in.’ \\n\\n‘Why?’ asked a surprised Ayurvati. \\n\\n‘I don’t know, my Lady. I am very sorry ’ \\n\\n‘That’s alright,’ said Ayurvati. ‘You’re only doing your job.’ \\n\\nVeerbhadra looked at Krittika. ‘I’m sorry darling.’ \\n\\n‘Please don’t call me that in public,’ whispered Krittika, embarrassed. \\n\\nSati pulled the curtain aside and entered the tent. \\n\\n‘I don’t know, my Lord,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘It doesn’t make sense.’ \\n\\nSati was surprised at Parvateshwar calling Shiva ‘My Lord’. \\n\\nBut her joy at seeing Shiva safe brushed these thoughts aside. ‘Shiva!’ \\n\\n‘Sati?’ mumbled Shiva, turning towards her. \\n\\nSati froze. He didn’t smile when he saw her. He didn’t have the flush of victory on his face. He \\nhadn’t even got his wounds dressed. \\n\\n‘What’s wrong?’ asked Sati. \\n\\nShiva stared at her. His expression worried her deeply. She turned towards Parvateshwar. He \\nlooted at her for an instant with an obviously forced smile. The way he usually smiled when he \\ntried to shield her from some bad news. ‘What is it, Pitratulya?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar looted at Shiva, who spoke at last. ‘Something about this war troubles us.’ \\n\\n‘What could trouble you?’asted a surprised Sati. ‘You have delivered the greatest victory ever \\nto the Suryavanshis. This defeat of the Chandravanshis is even more comprehensive than what \\nmy grandfather achieved. You should be proud!’ \\n\\n‘I didn’t see any Nagas with the Chandravanshis,’ said Shiva. \\n\\n‘The Nagas weren’t there?’ asked Sati. ‘That doesn’t mate sense.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Shiva, his eyes carrying a hint of foreboding. ‘If they are so thick with the \\n\\n\\n\\nChandravanshis, then they would have been there in the battlefield. If they were being used by \\nthe Chandravanshis against us, then their skills would have been even more useful in the battle. But \\nwhere were they?’ \\n\\n‘Maybe they’ve fallen out with each other,’ suggested Sati. \\n\\n‘I don’t think so,’said Parvateshwar. ‘This war was triggered by their joint attack on Mandar! \\nWhy would they not be here?’ \\n\\n‘Shiva, I am sure you’ll figure it out,’ said Sati. ‘Don’t trouble yourself.’ \\n\\n‘Dammit Sati!’yelled Shiva. ‘I can’t figure it out! That’s why I am worried!’ \\n\\nA startled Sati stepped back. His uncharacteristic vehemence stunned her. He wasn’t like this. \\nShiva realised what he had done. He immediately reached his bloodied hand out. ‘I’m sorry Sati. \\nIt’s just that I...’ \\n\\nThe conversation was interrupted as Daksha, accompanied by an aide, raised the curtain and \\nswaggered into the room. \\n\\n‘My Lord! ’ cried Daksha as he hugged Shiva tight. \\n\\nShiva flinched. His wounds hurt. Daksha immediately stepped back \\n\\n‘I’m so sorry, my Lord,’ said Daksha. Turning to his aide he continued, ‘Why is Ayurvati \\noutside? Bring her in. Let her tend to the Lord’s wounds.’ \\n\\n‘No wait,’said Shiva to the aide. ‘I had said I didn’t want to be disturbed. There is always time \\nto address the wounds later.’Shiva turned towards Daksha. ‘Your Highness, I need to speak about \\nsomething...’ \\n\\n‘My Lord, if you will allow me first,’said Daksha, as enthusiastic as a little boy who had just \\nbeen given a long denied sweet. ‘I wanted to thank you for what you have done for me. For \\nMeluha. We have done what even my father couldn’t! This is an absolute victory! ’ \\n\\nShiva and Parvateshwar looked briefly at each other before Daksha garnered their attention \\nagain. \\n\\n‘Emperor Dilipa is being brought here even as we speak;’ said Daksha. \\n\\n‘What?’asked Parvateshwar taken aback ‘But we had sent some of our soldiers to their camp \\njust a little while back They couldn’t possibly have arrested him so soon.’ \\n\\n‘No Parvateshwar,’said Daksha. ‘I had sent my personal guards much earlier. We could tell \\nfrom the viewing platform that the Chandravanshis had already lost by the time the Lord and you \\nbegan the third charge. That is the benefit of the perspective you get from a distance. I was \\nworried that Dilipa might escape life the coward he is. So I sent off my personal guards to arrest \\nhim.’ \\n\\n‘But, your Highness,’said Parvateshwar, ‘shouldn’t we discuss the terms of surrender before \\nwe bring him in? What are we going to offer?’ \\n\\n‘Offer?’ asked Daksha, his eyes twinkling with the euphoria of triumph. ‘Frankly, we don’t really \\nneed to offer anything considering how he was routed. He is being brought here as a common \\ncriminal. However, we will show him how kind Meluha can be. We will make him such an offer \\nthat his next seven generations will be singing our praises! ’ \\n\\nBefore a surprised Shiva could ask what exactly Daksha had in mind, the crier of the Royal \\nGuard announced the presence of Dilipa outside the tent. Accompanying him was his son, Crown \\nPrince Bhagirath. \\n\\n‘Just a minute, Kaustav,’said Daksha, as he went into a tizzy, organising the room exactly as he \\n\\n\\n\\nwould like it. He sat down on a chair placed in the centre of the room. Daksha requested Shiva to \\nsit to his right. As Shiva sat, Sati turned to leave the tent. Shiva reached out to hold her hand. She \\nturned, saw his need and walked behind his seat to sit down on a chair there. Parvateshwar sat to \\nthe Emperor’s left. \\n\\nDaksha then called out loudly, ‘Let him in.’ \\n\\nShiva was anxious to see the face of evil. Despite his misgivings about the absence of the \\nNagas, he genuinely believed he had fought a righteous war on the right side. Only seeing the \\ndefeated face of the evil king of the Chandravanshis would complete the victory. \\n\\nDilipa waited in. Shiva straightened up in surprise. Dilipa was nothing like what he expected. He \\nhad the appearance of an old man, a sight rare in Meluha due to the Somras. Despite his age, \\nDilipa had a rakishly handsome bearing. He was of medium height, had dark skin and a slightly \\nmuscular build. His clothes were radically different from the sober Meluhan fare. A bright pink \\ndhoti, gleaming violet angvastram and a profusion of gold jewellery adorning most parts of his \\nbody, combined to give him the look of a dandy. His face had the crowfeet of a life lived well. A \\ntrimmed salt and pepper beard, accompanied by thick white hair under his extravagandy \\ncoloured crown, completed the effete lookwhile adding an intellectual air. \\n\\n‘Where’s the Crown Prince Bhagirath?’ asked Daksha. \\n\\n‘I have asked him to wait outside since he can be a little hotheaded,’said Dilipa. He looted only \\nat Daksha, refusing to acknowledge the presence of the others in the room. ‘Don’t you Meluhans \\nhave any custom of offering a seat to your guests?’ \\n\\n‘You are not a guest, Emperor Dilipa,’ said Daksha. ‘You are a prisoner.’ \\n\\n‘Yes. Yes. I know. Can’t you get a joke?’ asked Dilipa superciliously. ‘So what is it that you \\npeople want this time?’ \\n\\nDaksha stared at Dilipa quizzically. \\n\\n‘You have already stolen the Yamuna waters a hundred years back,’continued Dilipa. ‘What \\nelse do you want?’ \\n\\nShiva turned in surprise towards Daksha. \\n\\n‘We did not steal the Yamuna waters,’ yelled Daksha angrily. \\n\\n‘They were ours and we took them back! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes whatever,’ dismissed Dilipa with a wave of his hand. \\n\\n‘What are your demands this time?’ \\n\\nShiva was astonished at how the conversation was going. They had just defeated this evil man. \\nHe should be repentant. But here he was, being condescending and self-righteous. \\n\\nDaksha looted at Dilipa with wide eyes and a kindly smile. ‘I don’t want to take anything. \\nInstead, I want to give you something.’ \\n\\nDilipa raised his eyebrows warily. ‘Give us something?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, I intend to give you the benefit of our way of life.’ \\n\\nDilipa continued to stare at Daksha with suspicion. \\n\\n‘We are going to bring you up to our superior way of life,’ continued Daksha, his eyes \\nmarvelling at his own generosity. ‘We are going to reform you.’ \\n\\nDilipa said with half a snigger, ‘Reform us?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. My general, Parvateshwar, will run your empire from now on as Viceroy of Swadweep. \\nYou will continue to be the titular head. Parvateshwar will ensure that your corrupt people are \\n\\n\\n\\nbrought in line with the Meluhan way of life. We will live together as brothers now.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar turned towards Daksha, stunned. He did not expect to be despatched to \\nSwadweep. \\n\\nDilipa appeared to have difficulty in controlling his laughter. ‘You actually think your straight- \\nlaced men can run Swadweep? My people are mercurial. They are not going to listen to your \\nmoralising!’ \\n\\n‘Oh, they will,’ sneered Daksha. ‘They will listen to everything we say. Because you don’t \\nknow where the actual voice comes from.’ \\n\\n‘Really ? Where does it come from? Do enlighten me.’ \\n\\nDaksha motioned towards Shiva and said, ‘Lookwho sits with us.’ \\n\\nDilipa turned to Daksha’s right and asked incredulously, ‘Who’s he? What in Lord Indra’s name \\nis so special about him?’ \\n\\nShiva squirmed, feeling increasingly uncomfortable. \\n\\nDaksha spoke a little louder. ‘Look at his throat, Oh king of the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\nDilipa looted again with the same arrogance towards Shiva. Despite the dried smattering of \\nblood and gore, the blue throat blazed. Suddenly, Dilipa’s haughty smile disappeared. He looted \\nshocked. He tried to say something, but he was at a loss of words. \\n\\n‘Yes, oh corrupt Chandravanshi,’scoffed Daksha, moving his hands for dramatic effect. ‘We \\nhave the Neelkanth.’ \\n\\nDilipa’s eyes had the dazed look of a child who had just discovered that the hand that brutally \\nknifed his back belonged to his beloved father. Shiva’s heart was disturbed with increased \\napprehension. This was not the way this meeting was supposed to occur. \\n\\nDaksha continued his hectoring. ‘The Neelkanth has sworn to destroy the evil Chandravanshi \\nway of life. You HAVE to listen.’ \\n\\nA bewildered Dilipa stared at Shiva for what seemed like an eternity. At long last, he recovered \\nenough to softly whisper, ‘Whatever you say.’ \\n\\nBefore Daksha could bluster further, Dilipa turned and staggered towards the tent curtain. At \\nthe exit, he turned around to look at Shiva once again. Shiva swore that he could see a few tears in \\nthose proud, haughty eyes. \\n\\nAs soon as Dilipa left the tent, Daksha got up and hugged Shiva, lightly, so as to not hurt the \\nNeelkanth. ‘My Lord, did you see the look on his face. It was precious!’ \\n\\nTurning towards Parvateshwar, he continued, ‘Parvateshwar, Dilipa is broken. You will have no \\ntrouble controlling the Swadweepans and bringing them around to our way of life. We will go \\ndown in history as the men who found a permanent solution to this problem! ’ \\n\\nShiva wasn’t paying attention. His troubled heart desperately searched for answers. How could \\na struggle that appeared so righteous, just a few hours back, now suddenly appear wrong? He \\nturned towards Sati, forlorn. She gently touched his shoulder. \\n\\n‘What are you thinking, my Lord?’ asked Daksha, intruding into Shiva’s troubled thoughts. \\n\\nShiva j ust shook his head. \\n\\n‘I just asked if you would like to travel in Dilipa’s carriage to Ayodhya?’asted Daksha. ‘You \\ndeserve the honour, my Lord. You have led us to this glorious day’ \\n\\nThis conversation did not appear important to Shiva at this point. He did not have the energy to \\nthink of an answer. He just nodded in an absentminded manner. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Wonderful. I’ll mate all the arrangements,’ said Daksha. Turning towards his aide, he \\ncontinued, ‘Send Ayurvati in to immediately dress the Lord’s wounds. We need to leave by \\ntomorrow morning to mate sure that we have control over Ayodhya, before chaos reigns in the \\naftermath of Dilipa’s defeat.’ \\n\\nWith a namaste towards Shiva, Daksha turned to leave. ‘Parvateshwar, aren’t you coming?’ \\n\\nParvateshwar gazed at Shiva, his face creased with concern. \\n\\n‘Parvateshwar?’ repeated Daksha. \\n\\nTaking a quick look at Sati, Parvateshwar turned to leave. Sati moved forward, holding Shiva’s \\nface gently. Shiva’s eyes seemed to droop with the heavy weight of tiredness. Ayurvati lifted the \\ncurtain carefully. ‘How are you, my Lord?’ \\n\\nShiva looted up, his eyes half shut. He was descending into a strange sleep. He yelled \\nsuddenly, ‘Nandi!’ \\n\\nNandi came rushing in. \\n\\n‘Nandi, can you find me a cravat?’ \\n\\n‘Cravat, my Lord?’ asked Nandi. \\n\\n‘Yes.’ \\n\\n‘Umm. But why, my Lord?’ \\n\\n‘BECAUSE I NEED IT!’ shouted Shiva. \\n\\nNandi, shocked at the violence of his Lord’s reply, hurried out. Sati and Ayurvati looted at \\nShiva in surprise. Before they could say anything, he suddenly collapsed. Unconscious. \\n\\n— — \\n\\nHe was running hard, the menacing forest closing in on him. He was desperate to get beyond \\nthe trees before they laid their ravenous claws on him. Suddenly, a loud insistent cry pierced \\nthrough the silence. \\n\\n‘Help! Please help!\\' \\n\\nHe stopped. No. He wouldn’t run away this time. He would fight that monster. He was the \\nMahadev. It was his duty. Shiva turned around slowly, his sword drawn, his shield held high. \\n\\n‘Jai Shri Ram!’he yelled, as he raced back to the clearing. The bushy thorns slashed his legs. \\nBleeding and terrified, he ran hard. \\n\\nI will reach her in time. \\n\\nI will not fail her again. \\n\\nMy blood will wash away my sin. \\n\\nHe sprang through the last clump of shrubs, letting the thorns cut greedily at his flesh, and leapt \\ninto the clearing. His shield held defensively, his sword gripped low to retaliate. But nobody \\nattacked. It was a strange laughter that finally broke his concentration. He lowered his shield. \\nSlowly. \\n\\n‘Oh Lord! ’ he shrieked in agony. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe woman lay stricken on the ground, a short sword buried into her heart. The little boy stood \\non her side. Stunned. His hand bloodied with the struggle of his kill. The hairy monster sat on the \\nrocky ledge, pointing at the little boy. Laughing. \\n\\n‘NO!’ screamed Shiva, as he jerked himself awake. \\n\\n‘What happened, Shiva?’ asked a worried Sati, darting to hold his hand. \\n\\nShiva looted around the room, startled. A worried Parvateshwar and Ayurvati got up too. ‘My \\nLord?’ \\n\\n‘Shiva, it’s alright. It’s alright,’ whispered Sati, gently running her hand along Shiva’s face. \\n\\n‘You were poisoned, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati. ‘We think that some of the Chandravanshi \\nsoldiers may have had poisoned weapons. It has affected many others as well.’ \\n\\nShiva slowly regained his composure. He got off his bed. Sati tried to help him up, but he \\ninsisted on doing it himself. His throat felt excruciatingly parched. He stumbled over to the ewer, \\nfollowed closely by Sati. He reached over and gulped down some water. \\n\\n‘It seems like I have been asleep for many hours,’said Shiva, finally noticing the lamps and \\ndark sky beyond. \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said a worried Ayurvati. ‘Close to thirty-six hours.’ \\n\\n‘Thirty-six hours!’cried a surprised Shiva, before collapsing on to a comfortable chair. He \\nnoticed a forbidding figure sitting at the back, his right eye covered in a bandage, his amputated \\nleft hand in a sling. ‘Drapaku?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Drapaku, as he tried to get up and salute. \\n\\n‘My God, Drapaku! It’s so good to see you. Please sit down!’ \\n\\n‘It is heavenly to see you, my Lord,’ \\n\\n‘How was your end of the battle?’ \\n\\n‘I lost too many men, my Lord. Almost half of them. And this arm and eye,’whispered \\nDrapaku. ‘But by your grace, we held them till the main battle was won.’ \\n\\n‘It wasn’t my grace, my friend. It was your bravery,’ said Shiva. ‘I am proud of you.’ \\n\\n‘Thankyou, my Lord.’ \\n\\nSati stood next to her husband, gently caressing his hair. ‘Are you sure you want to sit, Shiva? \\nYou can lie down for a while.’ \\n\\n‘I have slouched around enough, Sati,’ said Shiva with a weaksmile. \\n\\nAyurvati smiled. ‘Well, the poison certainly didn’t affect your sense of humour, my Lord.’ \\n\\n‘Really ? Is it still that bad?’ grinned Shiva. \\n\\nParvateshwar, Drapaku and Ayurvati laughed weakly. Sati didn’t. She was watching Shiva \\nintently. He was trying too hard. He was trying to forget, trying to get others to focus on \\nsomething other than himself. Was this dream much worse than the others? \\n\\n‘Where is his Highness?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\n‘Father left for Ayodhy a this morning,’ said Sati. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ said Parvateshwar, ‘His Highness felt it would not be right to keep Swadweep \\nwithout a sovereign for so long, considering the circumstances. He felt it important that the \\nSuryavanshi army be marched across the empire immediately, with Emperor Dilipa as prisoner, \\nso that the Swadweepans know and accept the new dispensation.’ \\n\\n‘So we’re not going to Ayodhy a?’ \\n\\n‘We will, my Lord,’ said Ayurvati. ‘But in a few days when you are strong enough.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Some twelve thousand of our soldiers remain with us,’said Parvateshwar. ‘We will march to \\nAy odhya when you are ready. His Highness insisted that Emperor Dilipa leave behind one of his \\nfamily members with our unit as hostage to ensure that no Swadweepan attacks our much smaller \\nforce.’ \\n\\n‘So we have one of Emperor Dilipa’s family members in our camp?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Parvateshwar. ‘His daughter, Princess Anandmayi.’ \\n\\nAyurvati smiled, shaking her head slightly. \\n\\n‘What?’ asked Shiva. \\n\\nAyurvati looked sheepishly at Parvateshwar and then grinned at Sati. Parvateshwar glared back \\nat Ayurvati. \\n\\n‘What happened?’ asked Shiva again. \\n\\n‘Nothing that important, my Lord,’clarified Parvateshwar, looking strangely embarrassed. ‘It’s \\njust that she is quite a handful.’ \\n\\n‘Well, I’ll ensure that I remain out of her way then,’ said Shiva, smiling. \\n\\n— AGTO® - \\n\\n‘So this route seems to make the most sense,’ said Parvateshwar, pointing at the map. \\n\\nShiva, and the other poisoned soldiers, had recovered completely over the previous five days. \\nThe march to Ayodhya was scheduled the next day. \\n\\n‘I think you are right,’ said Shiva, his mind going back to the meeting with the Emperor of \\nSwadweep. \\n\\nNo point in thinking about Dilipa. I’m sure he was acting during the meeting. The \\nChandravanshis are evil. They are capable of any deception. Our war was righteous. \\n\\n‘We plan to leave tomorrow morning, my Lord,’said Parvateshwar. Turning towards Sati, he \\ncontinued, ‘You can finally see the birthplace of Lord Ram, my child.’ \\n\\n‘Yes Pitratulya,’ smiled Sati. ‘But I don’t know if these people would have kept his temple \\nunharmed. They may have destroyed it in their hatred.’ \\n\\nTheir conversation was interrupted by a loud commotion. \\n\\nParvateshwar turned with a frown. ‘What is going on out there, Nandi?’ \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ said Nandi from the other side of the curtain. ‘The Princess Anandmayi is here. She \\nhas some demands. But we can’t fulfil them. She insists on meeting you.’ \\n\\n‘Please tell her Highness to wait in her tent,’growled Parvateshwar. ‘I will be over in a few \\nminutes.’ \\n\\n‘I cannot wait General! ’ screamed a strong, yet feminine voice from across the curtain. \\n\\nShiva signalled to Parvateshwar to let her in. Parvateshwar turned towards the curtain. ‘Nandi, \\nVeerbhadra, bring her in. But checkher first for any weapons.’ \\n\\nIn a few moments, Anandmayi, flanked by Nandi and Veerbhadra, entered Shiva’s tent. Shiva \\nraised his eyebrow at her presence. She was taller than her father. And distractingly beautiful. A \\n\\n\\n\\ndeep walnut coloured complexion complemented a body that was bountifully voluptuous, yet \\nhealthy. Her doe-shaped eyes were in a seductive half-stare, while her lips were in a perpetual \\npout that was sensual yet intimidating. She was provocatively clothed, with a dhoti that had been \\ntied dangerously low at the waist and ended many inches above her knees, while being tied \\nagonizingly tight at her curvaceous hips. It was just a little longer than the loincloth that the \\nMeluhan men tied during their ceremonial baths. Her blouse was similar to the cloth piece that \\nMeluhan women tied, except that it had been cut raunchily on the top to the shape of her ample \\nbreasts, affording a full view of her generous cleavage. She stood with her hips tilted to the side, \\nexuding raw passion. \\n\\n‘You really think I can hide some weapons in this?’ charged Anandmayi, pointing at her \\nclothes. \\n\\nA startled Nandi and Sati glared at her, while Shiva and Veerbhadra sported a surprised smile. \\nParvateshwar shookhis head slightly. \\n\\n‘How are you doing, Parvateshwar?’asked Anandmayi, flashing a smile while scanning him \\nfrom top to bottom, her eyebrows raised lasciviously. \\n\\nShiva couldn’t help smiling as he saw Parvateshwar blush slightly. \\n\\n‘What is it you desire, Princess?’barked Parvateshwar. ‘We are in the middle of an important \\nmeeting’ \\n\\n‘Will you really give me what I desire, General?’ sighed Anandmayi. \\n\\nParvateshwar blushed even deeper. ‘Princess, we have no time for nonsensical talk! ’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’groaned Anandmayi. ‘Most unfortunate. Then perhaps you can help me get some milk \\nand rose petals in this sorry little camp you are running.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar turned towards Nandi in surprise. Nandi blabbered, ‘My Lord, she doesn’t want \\njust a glass, but fifty litres of milk. We can’t allow that with our rations.’ \\n\\n‘You are going to drink fifty litres of milk?’ cried Parvateshwar, his eyes wide in astonishment. \\n\\n‘I need it for my beauty bath, General!’glowered Anandmayi. ‘You are going to take us on a \\nlong march from tomorrow. I cannot go unprepared.’ \\n\\n‘I will try and see what I can do,’ said Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Don’t try, General. Do it, ’ admonished Anandmayi. \\n\\nShiva couldn’t control himself any longer. He burst out laughing. \\n\\n‘What the hell do you thinkyou are laughing at?’ glared Anandmayi, turning towards Shiva. \\n\\n‘You will speak to the Lord with respect, Princess,’ yelled Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘The Lord?’ grinned Anandmayi. ‘So he is the one in charge? The one Daksha was allegedly \\nshowing off?’ \\n\\nShe turned back towards Shiva. ‘What did you say to trouble my father so much that he isn’t \\neven talking any more? You don’t look that threatening to me.’ \\n\\n‘Be careful about what you say, Princess,’advised Parvateshwar fiercely. ‘You don’t know \\nwhom you are speaking with.’ \\n\\nShiva raised his hand at Parvateshwar, signalling him to calm down. But Anandmayi was the \\none who required soothing. \\n\\n‘Whoever you are, you will all be smashed when our Lord comes. When he descends to \\nSwadweep and destroys the evil of your kind.’ \\n\\nWhat?! \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Take her out of here, Nandi,’ yelled Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘No wait/said Shiva. Turning towards Anandmayi, he asked, ‘What did you mean by saying \\n“when your Lord will descend to Swadweep and destroy the evil of our kind”? ’ \\n\\n‘Why should I answer you, Parvateshwar\\'s Lord? ’ \\n\\nParvateshwar moved rapidly, drawing his sword and pointing it close to Anandmayi’s neck \\n‘When the Lord asks something, you will answer! ’ \\n\\n‘Do you always move that fast?’asked Anandmayi, her eyebrows raised saucily. ‘Or can you \\ntake it slow sometimes?’ \\n\\nBringing his sword threateningly closer, Parvateshwar repeated, ‘Answer the Lord, Princess.’ \\n\\nShaking her head, Anandmayi turned towards Shiva. ‘We wait for our Lord who will come to \\nSwadweep and destroy the evil Suryavanshis.’ \\n\\nStrong lines of worry began creasing Shiva’s handsome face. ‘Who is your Lord?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know. He hasn’t shown himself as yet.’ \\n\\nAn unfathomable foreboding sunk deep into Shiva’s heart. He was profoundly afraid of his next \\nquestion. But something inside told him that he had to ask it. ‘How will you know he is your Lord?’ \\n\\n‘Why are you so interested in this?’ \\n\\n‘I need to know! ’ snarled Shiva. \\n\\nAnandmayi frowned at Shiva as if he was mad. ‘He will not be from the Sapt-Sindhu. Neither a \\nSury avanshi nor a Chandravanshi. But when he comes, he will come on our side.’ \\n\\nShiva’s inner voice whispered miserably that there was more. Clutching the armrest of his \\nchair, he asked, ‘And?’ \\n\\n‘And,’ continued Anandmayi, ‘his throat will turn blue when he drinks the Somras.’ \\n\\nAn audible gasp escaped Shiva as his body stiffened. The world seemed to spin. Anandmayi \\nfrowned, even more confused about the strange conversation. \\n\\nParvateshwar glowered fiercely at Anandmayi. ‘You are lying, woman! Admit it! You are \\nlying!’ \\n\\n‘Why would I...’ \\n\\nAnandmayi stopped in mid-sentence as she noticed Shiva’s cravat covered throat. The \\narrogance suddenly vanished from her face. She found her knees buckling under her. Pointing \\nweakly with her hands, she asked, ‘Why is your throat covered?’ \\n\\n‘Take her out, Nandi! ’ ordered Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Who are you?’ shouted Anandmayi. \\n\\nNandi and Veerbhadra tried to pull Anandmayi out. With surprising strength, she struggled \\nagainst them. ‘Show me your throat!’ \\n\\nThey held on to her arms and dragged her backwards. She kicked Veerbhadra in the groin, \\ncausing him to fall back in pain as she turned towards Shiva once again. ‘Who the hell are you?’ \\n\\nShiva stared down at the table unable to find the strength to even glance at Anandmayi. He held \\nhis armrest tightly. It seemed to be the only stable thing in a world spinning desperately out of \\ncontrol. \\n\\nVeerbhadra staggered back, held her arms tighdy and pulled her backas Nandi held her by the \\nneck Anandmayi bit Nandi’s arm brutally. As a howling Nandi pulled his arm bacl^ she \\nscreamed again, ‘Answer me, dammit! Who are you?’ \\n\\nShiva looted up for one brief instant at Anandmayi’s tormented eyes. The pain they conveyed \\n\\n\\n\\nlashed his soul. The flames of agony burned his conscience. \\n\\nA shocked Anandmayi suddenly became immobile. The misery in her eyes would have \\nstunned the bravest of Meluhan soldiers. In a broken voice, she whispered, ‘You are supposed to \\nbe on our side... ’ \\n\\nShe allowed herself to be hauled out by Nandi and Veerbhadra. Parvateshwar kept his eyes \\ndown. He dared not look at Shiva. He was a good Suryavanshi. He would not humiliate his Lord \\nby looking at him at his weakest. Sati, on the other hand, would not leave her husband to suffer \\nalone, by not looking at him when he was at his weakest. She came to his side, touching his face. \\n\\nShiva looked up, his eyes devastated with the tears of sorrow. ‘What have I done?’ \\n\\nSati held Shiva tightly, holding his throbbing head against her bosom. There was nothing she \\ncould say to alleviate the pain. She could just hold him. \\n\\nAn agonized whisper suffused the tent with its resonant grief. ‘What have I done?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25 \\n\\n\\nIsland of the Individual \\n\\n\\nIt was another three weeks before Shiva’s entourage reached Ayodhya, the capital of the \\nSwadweepans. They had travelled along a decrepit, long-winding road to the Ganga, and then \\nsailed eastward to the point where the mighty, yet capricious, river passionately welcomed the \\nwaters of the Sarayu. Then they had cruised north, up the Sarayu, to the city of Lord Ram’s birth. \\nIt was a long circuitous route, but the quietest possible considering the terrible road conditions in \\nSwadweep, the island of the individual. \\n\\nThe excitement in the hearts of the Meluhan soldiers was beyond compare. They had only \\nheard legends about Lord Ram’s city. None had ever seen it. Ayodhya, literally the impregnable \\ncity, was the land first blessed by Lord Ram’s sacred feet. They expected a gleaming city \\nbeyond compare, even if it had been devastated by the Chandravanshi presence. They expected \\nthe city to be an oasis of order and harmony even if all the surrounding land had been rendered \\nchaotic by the Chandravanshis. They were disappointed. \\n\\nAyodhya was nothing like Devagiri. At first glance, it promised much. The outer walls were \\nthick and looted astonishingly powerful. Unlike the sober grey Meluhan walls, the exterior of \\nAyodhya had been extravagantly painted with every colour in god’s universe. Each alternate \\nbrick, however, was painted in pristine white, the royal colour of the Chandravanshis. Numerous \\nbanners, tinted in pink and blue, had been festooned down the city towers. The banners weren’t \\nput up for a special occasion, but were permanent fixtures, adorning the city. \\n\\nThe empire road curved suddenly along the fort wall to the main entrance, so as to prevent \\nelephants and battering rams from getting a straight run to the mighty doors. At the top of the \\nmain gates, a wonderfully ornate, horizontal crescent moon had been sculpted into the walls. \\nBelow it was the Chandravanshi motto. ‘Shringar. Saundarya. Swatantrata.\\' Passion. Beauty. \\nFreedom. \\n\\nIt was only when one entered the city that it delivered a blow to the precision and order loving \\nMeluhans. Krittika described the city’s organisation best as ‘functioning pandemonium’. Unlike all \\nMeluhan cities, Ayodhya was not built on a platform — so it was obvious that if the Sarayu river \\never flooded in the manner that the temperamental Indus did, the city would be inundated. The \\nnumerous city walls, built in seven concentric circles, were surprisingly thick and strong. \\nHowever, it didn’t take a general’s strategic eye to see that the concentric walls had not been \\nplanned by a military mastermind. They were in fact added in a haphazard manner, one by one, \\nafter the city had burst its seams and extended beyond the previous perimeter. That is why there \\n\\n\\n\\nwere many weak points along each wall, which an enemy laying siege could easily exploit. \\nPerhaps that’s why the Chandravanshis preferred to take wars outside to a far away battleground \\nrather than defend their city. \\n\\nThe infrastructure was a sorry indictment of the Chandravanshi penchant for debate as an \\nexcuse for action. The roads were nothing better than dirt tracks. There was, however, one \\nnotable exception — the neatly paved and strikingly smooth Rajpath, the royal road, which led \\nstraight from the outer walls through to the opulent royal palace. The Swadweepans joked that \\ninstead of finding potholes on their road, they actually had to search for some stretch of road \\namongst the potholes! This was a far cry from the exceptionally well-planned, sign-posted, paved \\nand tediously standard roads of Meluhan cities. \\n\\nThere were, what can only be called ‘encroachments’, all over the city. Some open grounds \\nhad been converted into giant slums as illegal immigrants simply pitched their tents on public \\nareas. The already narrow roads had been made even narrower by the intrusion of the cloth tents \\nof the homeless. There was constant tension between the richer home owning class and the poor \\nlandless who lived in slums. The emperor had legalised all encroachments established before \\n1910 BC. That meant that slum dwellers could not be removed unless the government created \\nalternate accommodation for them. The minor problem was that the Chandravanshi government \\nwas so hideously inefficient that they hadn’t managed to build even one new house for slum \\ndwellers in the last twelve years. Now there was talk about extending the deadline further. The \\nencroachments, the bad roads, the poor construction combined to give an impression of a city in a \\nstate of terminal decline. \\n\\nThe Meluhans were outraged. What had these people done to Lord Ram’s great city? Or was it \\nalways like this? Is that why Lord Ram had crossed the Sarayu river to establish his capital at far \\naway Devagiri on the Saraswati? \\n\\nAnd yet, as the initial shock of the ugliness and frenzied disorder wore away, the Meluhans \\nstarted finding strange and unexpected charm about this city in constant chaos. None of the \\nAyodhyan houses were similar, unlike the Meluhan cities where even the royal palace was built \\nto a standard design. Here each house had its own individual allure. The Swadweepans, \\nunencumbered by strict rules and building codes, created houses that were expressions of passion \\nand elegance. Some structures were so grand that even the Meluhans couldn’t imagine what \\ndivine engineering talent could create them. The Swadweepans had none of the restraint of the \\nMeluhans. Everything was painted bright — from orange buildings to parrot green ceilings to \\nshocking pink windows! Civic-minded rich Swadweepans had created grand public gardens, \\ntemples, theatres and libraries, naming them after their family members, since they had \\nreceived no help from the government. The Meluhans, despite finding it strange that a public \\nbuilding should be named after a private family, were awed by the grandeur of these structures. \\nA vibrant city, with exquisite beauty existing side by side with hideous ugliness, Ayodhya \\ndisgusted and yet fascinated the Meluhans. \\n\\nThe people were living embodiments of the Chandravanshi way of life. The women wore \\nskimpy clothes, brazen and confident about their sexuality. The men were as fashion and beauty \\nconscious as their women — what Meluhans would call dandies. The relationship between the \\nmen and women could only be characterised as one teetering on extremes. Extreme love \\ncoexisting with extreme hate, expressed with extreme loudness, all built on the foundations of \\n\\n\\n\\nextreme passion. Nothing was done in small measure in Ayodhya. Moderation was a word that \\ndid not exist in their dictionary. \\n\\nTherefore, it was no surprise that the emotional, mercurial and uncontrollable rabble of \\nAyodhya scoffed at Daksha’s proclaimed intention to ‘reform’them. Daksha entered a sullen \\ncity, as its populace stood quietly on the sides of the Raj path, refusing to welcome the conquering \\nforce. Daksha, who had expected the Ayodhya residents to welcome him with showers of \\nflowers since they had finally been freed from their evil rulers, was surprised at the cold \\nreception he got. He put it down to enforcement by the Chandravanshi royalty. \\n\\nShiva, who arrived a week later, was under no such illusions. He had expected far worse than \\njust a quiet greeting. He expected to be attacked. He expected to be vilified for not standing up for \\nthe Swadweepans, who also believed in the legend of the Neelkanth. He expected to be hated for \\nchoosing the so-called wrong side. But while he had come to suspect that the Chandravanshis \\nwere not quite evil, he was not prepared to classify the Suryavanshis as the ‘wrong side’either. In \\nhis opinion, the Meluhans were almost without exception honest, decent, law-abiding people who \\ncould be unvaryingly trusted. Shiva was deeply confused about his karma and his future course of \\naction. He missed Brahaspati’s keen wit and advice. \\n\\nHis thoughts weighing heavy on him, Shiva quickly disembarked from the curtained cart and \\nturned towards the Chandravanshi palace. For a moment, he was startled by the grandeur of \\nDilipa’s abode. But he quickly gathered his wits, reached out for Sati’s hand, and began climbing \\nthe hundred steps towards the main palace platform. Parvateshwar trudged slowly behind. Shiva \\nglanced briefly beyond Sati, to find Anandmayi ascending the steps quietly. She had not spoken to \\nShiva since that terrible encounter when she realised who Shiva was. She kept climbing with an \\nimpassive face, devoid of any expression, her eyes set on her father. \\n\\n‘Who the hell is that man?’asked an incredulous Swadweepan carpenter, held back at the edge \\nof the palace courtyard by Chandravanshi soldiers. \\n\\n‘Why are our Emperor and the sincere madman waiting for him on the royal platform, and \\nthat too in full imperial regalia?’ \\n\\n‘Sincere madman?’ asked his friend. \\n\\n‘Oh, haven’t you heard? That is the new nickname for that fool Daksha! ’ \\n\\nThe friends burst out laughing. \\n\\n‘Shush!’hissed an old man, standing next to them. ‘Don’t you young people have any sense? \\nAyodhya is being humiliated and you are joking around.’ \\n\\nMeanwhile, Shiva had reached the royal platform. Daksha bent low with a namaste as Shiva \\nsmiled weakly and returned the greeting. \\n\\nDilipa, his eyes moist, bent low towards Shiva. He cried in a soft whisper, ‘I am not evil, my \\nLord. We are not evil.’ \\n\\n‘What was that?’ asked Daksha, his ears straining to hear Dilipa’s whispered words. \\n\\nShiva’s choked throat refused to utter a sound. Not hearing anything from Dilipa either, Daksha \\nshookhis head and whispered, ‘My Lord, perhaps this is an opportune time to introduce you to the \\npeople of Ayodhya. I am sure it will galvanize them into action once they know that the \\nNeelkanth has come to their rescue.’ \\n\\nBefore an anguished Shiva could answer, his caring wife spoke, ‘Father, Shiva is very tired. It \\nhas been a long journey. May he rest for some time?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Yes, of course,’mumbled Dalsha apologetically. Turning towards Shiva, he said, ‘I am sorry, \\nmy Lord. Sometimes my enthusiasm gets the better of me. Why don’t you rest today? We can \\nalways introduce you at the court tomorrow.’ \\n\\nShiva looted up at Dilipa’s angst ridden eyes. Unable to bear the tormented gaze any longer, \\nShiva looted beyond the Chandravanshi emperor, towards his courtiers standing at the back Only \\none pair of eyes did not have a look of incomprehension. It was at that moment that Shiva realised \\nthat except for Anandmayi, nobody else in Dilipa’s court knew of his identity. Not even Dilipa’s \\nson, Bhagirath. Dilipa had not spoken to a soul. Clearly, neither had Daksha. Possibly in the hope \\nof a grand unveiling of the secret, in the presence of Shiva himself. \\n\\n‘My Lord.’ \\n\\nShiva turned towards Parvateshwar. ‘Yes,’ he said in a, barely audible whisper. \\n\\n‘I will lead the army out since the ceremonial march is over,’said Parvateshwar. ‘They will be \\nstationed outside the city in the camp for the earlier contingent. I will be back at your service \\nwithin two hours.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded faintly. \\n\\n\\n— — \\n\\nIt had been a few hours since their arrival in Ayodhya. Shiva had not spoken a word. He stood \\nquietly at the window of his chamber, staring out at the city as the afternoon sun bore down in its \\ndazzling glory. Sati sat silently to his side, holding his hand, drawing all the energy that she had \\nand passing it to him. He continued to stare out, towards a grand structure right in the heart of the \\ncity. The structure, from this distance, appeared to be built of white marble. For an unfathomable \\nreason, looking at it seemed to soothe Shiva’s soul. It was built upon the highest point in the city, on \\na gently sloping hill, clearly visible from every part of Ayodhya. Shiva thought it odd. Why was \\nthat building so important that it occupied the highest point in the city, instead of the royal palace? \\n\\nA loud insistent knocking disturbed his thoughts. \\n\\n‘Who is it?’ growled Parvateshwar, rising from his chair at the back of the chamber. \\n\\n‘My Lord,’ answered Nandi. ‘It is the Princess Anandmayi.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar groaned softly before turning towards Shiva. The Neelkanth nodded. \\n\\n‘Let her in, Nandi,’ ordered Parvateshwar. \\n\\nAnandmayi entered, her smiling demeanour startling Parvateshwar who frowned in suspicious \\nsurprise. ‘How may I help you, your Highness?’ \\n\\n‘I have told you so many times how you can help me, Parvateshwar,’teased Anandmayi. \\n‘Perhaps if you listened to the answer rather than repeating the question again and again, we may \\nactually get somewhere.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar’s reaction was a combination of embarrassment and anger. Shiva smiled \\nweakly, for the first time in three weeks. For some reason, the fact that Anandmayi seemed to \\nhave returned to her original self made Shiva happy. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnandmayi turned towards Shiva with a low bow. The truth has just come to me, my Lord. I \\nam sorry about my sullenness earlier. But I was deeply troubled at the time. Your being on the \\nside of the Suryavanshis can have only one of two explanations. Either we are evil. Or you are \\nnot who we think you are and the legend is false. Accepting either of these explanations would \\ndestroy my soul.’ \\n\\nShiva looked at Anandmayi attentively. \\n\\n‘But I realised only now,’continued Anandmayi. The legend is not false. And we are obviously \\nnot evil. It is just that you are too naive. You have been misled by the evil Suryavanshis. I will set \\nit right. I will show you the goodness of our path.’ \\n\\n‘We are not evil,’ glowered Parvateshwar. \\n\\n‘Parvateshwar,’sighed Anandmayi. ‘I have told you before. That lovely mouth of yours has \\nmuch better uses than talking. You shouldn’t waste your breath unnecessarily.’ \\n\\n‘Stop your impudence, woman!’ cried Parvateshwar. You thinkwe are evil?Have you seen the \\nway you treat your own people. Hungry eyes have stared at me all through our journey. \\nChildren lie abandoned on the side of potholed highways. Old desperate women beg for alms all \\nthrough your “impregnable city”, while the Swadweepan rich lead lives better than a Meluhan \\nemperor. We have a perfect society in Meluha. I may agree with the Lord and accept that \\nmaybe you are not evil. But you certainly don’t know how to take care of your people. Come to \\nMeluha to see how citizens should be treated. All your lives will improve with our way of \\ngovernance.’ \\n\\n‘Improve?’argued an agitated Anandmayi. ‘We are not perfect, I agree. There are many \\nthings that our empire could do better, I agree. But at least we give our people freedom. They are \\nnot forced to follow some stupid laws mandated by an out of touch elite.’ \\n\\n‘Give them freedom? Freedom to do what? Loot, steal, beg, kill?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t need to argue with you on our culture. Your puny mind will not be able to understand \\nthe benefit of our ways.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t want to! It disgusts me to see the way this empire has been managed. You have no \\nnorms. No control. No laws. It is no wonder that despite not being evil, you have contaminated \\nyour hands by allying with the Nagas. By fighting like coward terrorists and not brave Kshatriyas. \\nYou may not be evil, but your deeds certainly are!’ \\n\\n‘Nagas? What the bloody hell are you talking about? Do you thinkwe are mad that we will ally \\nwith the Nagas? You thinkwe don’t know how that will pollute our souls for the next seven lives? \\nAnd terrorism? We have never resorted to terrorism. We have strained against our natural \\ninstincts to avoid a war with your cursed people for the last hundred years. Hence we have \\nretreated from the border provinces. We have cut all ties with you. We have even learned to live \\nwith the lower flow of the Ganga since you stole the Yamuna from us. My father told you that \\nwe had nothing to do with the attack on Mount Mandar! But you did not believe us. And why \\nshould you? You needed an excuse to attackus again!’ \\n\\n‘Don’t lie to me. At least not in front of the Mahadev! Chandravanshi terrorists have been found \\nwith the Nagas.’ \\n\\n‘My father told you that nobody under our control had anything to do with the attack on \\nMandar. We have nothing to do with the Nagas. It’s possible that some Chandravanshis, just like \\nsome Suryavanshis, could have helped the terrorists. If you had worked with us, we may have \\n\\n\\n\\neven found the criminals!’ \\n\\n‘What rubbish is this? No Suryavanshi would ally with those monsters. As for some \\nChandravanshis assisting the terrorists, you’ll have to answer for that. Swadweep is under your \\ncontrol! ’ \\n\\n‘If you had kept diplomatic relations with Swadweep, you would have known that we are a \\nconfederacy, not authoritarian like you. Ayodhya is only the overlord. Other kings within \\nSwadweep pay us tribute for protection during war. Otherwise, they have the freedom to run \\ntheir kingdoms any way they choose.’ \\n\\n‘How is that possible? You’re saying the Emperor of Swadweep doesn’t run his own empire?’ \\n\\n‘Please,’begged Shiva, stopping the argument which reflected the debate raging in his mind. \\nHe did not want to be troubled by questions for which he had no answers. At least not yet. \\n\\nParvateshwar and Anandmayi immediately fell silent. \\n\\nTurning slowly towards the window again, he asked, ‘What is that building, Anandmayi?’ \\n\\n‘That, my Lord,’ said Anandmayi, smiling happily at being spoken to first, ‘is the \\nRamjanmabhoomi temple, built at the site of Lord Ram\\'s birthplace .’ \\n\\n‘You have built a temple to Lord Ram?’ asked a startled Parvateshwar. ‘But he was a \\nSuryavanshi. Your sworn enemy.’ \\n\\n‘We did not build the temple,’said Anandmayi, raising her eyes in exasperation. ‘But we have \\nrefurbished and maintained it lovingly. And furthermore, what mates you think Lord Ram was \\nour sworn enemy. He may have been misled to follow a different path, but he did a lot of good \\nfor the Chandravanshis as well. He is respected as a God in Ayodhya.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar’s eyes widened in shock. ‘But he had sworn to destroy the Chandravanshis.’ \\n\\n‘If he had vowed to destroy us, we wouldn’t exist today, would we? He left us unharmed \\nbecause he believed that we were good. That our way of life deserved to survive.’ \\n\\nParvateshwar was perturbed, out of arguments. \\n\\n‘You know what Lord Ram’s full ceremonial name is?’asked Anandmayi, pressing home her \\nadvantage. \\n\\n‘Of course I do,’scoffed Parvateshwar. ‘Lord Ram, Suryavanshi Kshatriya of the Ikshvaku \\nclan. Son of Dashrath and Kaushalya. Husband of Sita. Honoured and respected with the tide of \\nthe seventh Vishnu.’ \\n\\n‘Perfect,’beamed Anandmayi. ‘Except for one minor mistake. You have missed one small \\nword, General. You have missed the word Chandra. His full name was Lord Ram Chandra. ’ \\n\\nParvateshwar frowned. \\n\\n‘Yes, General,’continued Anandmayi. ‘His name meant “the face of the moon”. He was more \\nChandravanshi than you know’ \\n\\n‘This is typical Chandravanshi double talk,’argued Parvateshwar, gathering his wits. ‘You are \\nlost in words and names rather than deeds. Lord Ram said that only a person’s karma determines \\nhis identity. The fact that his name had the word moon in it means nothing. His deeds were \\nworthy of the sun. He was a Suryavanshi, through and through.’ \\n\\n‘Why couldn’t he have been both Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi?’ \\n\\n‘What nonsense is that? It’s not possible. It’s contradictory.’ \\n\\n‘It appears impossible to you only because your puny mind cannot understand it. \\nContradictions are a part of nature.’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘No, they aren’t. It is impossible that one thing be true and the opposite not be false. The \\nuniverse cannot accept that. One scabbard can have only one sword! ’ \\n\\n‘That is only if the scabbard is small. Are you saying that Lord Ram was not big enough to \\nhave two identities?’ \\n\\n‘You are just playing with words! ’ glared Parvateshwar. \\n\\nShiva had stopped listening. He turned towards the window. Towards the temple. He could feel \\nit in every pore of his body. He could feel it in his soul. He could hear the soft whisper of his inner \\nvoice. \\n\\nLard Ram will help you. He will guide you. He will soothe you. Go to him. \\n\\n— Aom — \\n\\nIt was the third hour of the third prahar when Shiva stole into the chaotic Ayodhya streets by \\nhimself. He was on his way to meet Lord Ram. Sati had not offered to come along. She knew that \\nhe needed to be alone. Wearing a cravat and a loose shawl for protection, with a sword and shield \\nfor abundant precaution, Shiva ambled along, taking in the strange sights and smells of the \\nChandra vanshi capital. Nobody recognised him. He liked it that way. \\n\\nThe Ayodhyans seemed to live their life without even the slightest hint of self-control. Loud \\nemotional voices assaulted Shiva’s ears as if a hideous orchestra was trying to overpower the \\nsenses. The common people either laughed like they had just gulped an entire bottle of wine or \\nfought like their lives depended on it. Shiva was pushed and barged on several occasions by \\npeople rushing around, hurling obscenities and calling him blind. There were manic shoppers \\nbargaining with agitated shopkeepers at the bazaar and it almost seemed like they would come to \\nblows over ridiculously small amounts of money. For both the shoppers and shopkeepers, the \\nharried negotiation wasn’t about the cash itself. It was about their honour in having struck a good \\nbargain. \\n\\nShiva noticed a large number of couples crowded into a small garden on the side of the road \\ndoing unspeakable things to each other. They seemed to brazenly disregard the presence of \\nvoyeuristic eyes on the street or in the park itself. He noticed with surprise that the eyes staring \\nfrom the street were not judgemental, but excited. Shiva noted the glaring contrast with the \\nMeluhans who would not even embrace each other in public. \\n\\nShiva suddenly started in surprise as he felt a feminine hand brush lightly against his backside. \\nHe turned sharply to notice a young woman grin backat him and wink Before Shiva could react, \\nhe spotted a much older woman walking right behind. Thinking of her to be the younger woman’s \\nmother, Shiva decided to let the indiscretion pass for fear of causing any embarrassment. As he \\nturned, he felt a hand on his backside again, this time more insistent and aggressive. He turned \\naround and was shocked to find the mother smiling sensuously at him. A flabbergasted Shiva \\nhurried down the road, escaping the bazaar before any more passes could stun his composure. \\n\\nHe continued walking in the direction of the towering Ramjanmabhoomi temple. As he \\n\\n\\n\\napproached, the unassailable jangle of Ayodhya dimmed significantly. This was a quiet \\nresidential area of the city. Probably for the rich, judging by the exquisite mansions and the \\navenues. Turning to the right, he came upon the road which led to his destination. It curved \\nsmoothly up the hill, caressing its sides in a sensuous arc. This was probably the only road in \\nAyodhya, besides the Rajpath, not pitted with potholes. Magnificent gulmohur trees rose \\nbrilliantly along the flanks of the road, their dazzling orange leaves lighting the path for the weary \\nand the lost. The path leading towards their answers. The path to Lord Ram. \\n\\nShiva closed his eyes and took a deep breath as anxiety gnawed at his heart. What would he \\nfind? Would he find peace? Would he find answers? Would he, as he hoped, find that he had done \\nsome good? Good that wasn’t visible to him right now. Or would he be told that he had made a \\nterrible mistake and thousands had died a senseless death? Shiva opened his eyes slowly, steeled \\nhimself and began walking, softly repeating the name of the Lord. \\n\\nRam. Ram. Ram. Ram. \\n\\nA little distance up, Shiva’s chant was disturbed. At an arched twist of the road, he saw an old, \\nshrivelled man, who appeared like he hadn’t eaten in weeks. He had a wound on his ankle which \\nhad festered because of the humidity and neglect. He was dressed in a torn jute sack, tied \\nprecariously at his waist and hung from his shoulders with a hemp rope. Sitting on the sidewalk, \\nhis sinewy right hand scratched vigorously at his head, disturbing the lice going about their job \\ndiligently. With his weak left hand, he precariously balanced a banana leaf which held a piece of \\nbread and gruel. It looked like the kind of food distributed at cheap restaurants on the donations of \\na few kindly or guilty souls. The kind of food that would not even be fed to animals in Meluha. \\n\\nIntense anger surged through Shiva. This old man was begging, nay suffering, at the doors of \\nLord Ram’s abode and nobody seemed to care. What kind of government would treat its people \\nlike this? In Meluha, the government assiduously nurtured all its citizens. There was enough food \\nfor everyone. Nobody was homeless. The government actually worked. This old man would not \\nhave had to endure this humiliation if he lived in Devagiri! \\n\\nThe anger in Shiva gave way to a flood of positive energy, as he realised that he had found his \\nanswer. He knew now that Parvateshwar was right. Maybe the Chandravanshis were not evil, but \\nthey led a wretched existence. The Suryavanshi system would improve their lives dramatically. \\nThere would be abundance and prosperity all around when Parvateshwar honed the moribund \\nChandravanshi administration. There will be some good that will come out of this war. Maybe he \\nhad not made such a terrible mistake. He thanked Lord Ram. He thought he had found his answer. \\n\\nFate, however, conspired to deny Shiva this small consolation. The old beggar noticed Shiva \\nstaring at him. Shiva’s sympathetic eyes and compassionate smile caused the beggar’s haggard \\ncheeks to spring to life, as he smiled in return. However, it wasn’t the smile of a broken man \\nbegging for alms. It was the warm welcoming smile of a man at peace with himself. Shiva was \\ntaken aback. \\n\\nThe old man smiled even more warmly while raising his weak hand with great effort. ‘Would \\nyou like some food, my son?’ \\n\\nShiva was stunned. He felt small against the mighty heart of the wretched man he had thought \\nwas deserving of pity and kindness. \\n\\nSeeing Shiva gaping, the old man repeated, ‘Would you like to eat with me, son? There is \\nenough for both.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nAn overwhelmed Shiva could not find the strength to speak There wasn’t enough food for even \\none man. Why was this man offering to share what little food he had? It didn’t make sense. \\n\\nThinking Shiva to be hard of hearing, the old man spoke a litde louder. ‘My son, sit with me. \\nEat.’ \\n\\nShiva struggled to find the strength to shake his head slightly. ‘No thankyou, sir.’ \\n\\nThe old man’s face fell immediately. ‘This is good food,’he said, his eyes showing the hurt he \\nfelt. ‘I would not offer it to you otherwise.’ \\n\\nShiva realised that he had insulted the old man’s pride. He had just treated him like a beggar. \\n‘No, no, that’s not what I meant. I know it’s good food. It’s just that I...’ \\n\\nThe old man interrupted Shiva’s words with a warm grin. ‘Then sit with me, my son.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded quietly. He sat down on the pavement. The old man turned towards Shiva and \\nplaced the banana leaf on the ground, in between the two of them. Shiva looted at the bread and \\nwatery gruel, which until moments back appeared unfit for humans. The old man looted up at \\nShiva, his half blind eyes beaming. ‘Eat.’ \\n\\nShiva picked up a small morsel of the bread, dipped it in the gruel and swallowed. It slipped into \\nhis body easily, but weighed heavy on his soul. He could feel his righteousness being squeezed out \\nof him as the poor, old man beamed generously. \\n\\n‘Come on, my son. If you are going to eat so litde, how will you maintain your big muscular \\nbody?’ \\n\\nA starded Shiva glanced up at the old man; the circumference of those shrunken arms would \\nhave been smaller than Shiva’s wrist. The old man was taking ridiculously small bites, moving \\nlarger portions of the bread towards Shiva. Shiva could not find the heart to lookup any more. As \\nhis heart sank deeper and his tears rose, he ate the portion the old man gave him quickly. The food \\nwas over in no time. \\n\\nFreedom. Freedom for the wretched to also have dignity. Something impossible in Meluha’s \\nsystem of governance. \\n\\n‘Are you full now, my son?’ \\n\\nShiva nodded slowly, still not daring to look into the old man’s eyes. \\n\\n‘Good. Go. It’s a long walk to the temple.’ \\n\\nShiva looted up, bewildered at the astounding generosity being shown to him. The old man’s \\nsunken cheeks were spread wide as he smiled affectionately. He was on the verge of starvation, \\nand yet he had given practically all his food to a stranger. Shiva cursed his own heart for the \\nblasphemy he had committed. The blasphemy of thinking that he could actually ‘save’such a \\nman. Shiva found himself bending forward, as if in the volition of a greater power. He extended \\nhis arms and touched the feet of the old man. \\n\\nThe old man raised his hand and touched Shiva’s head tenderly, blessing him. ‘May you find \\nwhat you are looking for, my son.’ \\n\\nShiva got up, his heart heavy with tears of guilt, his throat choked with the cry of remorse, his \\nsoul leaden and its self-righteousness crushed by the old man’s munificence. He knew his answer. \\nWhat he had done was wrong. He had committed a terrible mistake. These people were not evil. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 26 \\n\\n\\nThe Question of Questions \\n\\nThe road to the Ramjanmabhoomi temple clung to the sides of a gently sloping hill, before ending \\nits journey at Lord Ram’s abode. It afforded a breathtaking view of the city below. But Shiva did \\nnot see it. Neither did he see the magnificent construction of the gigantic temple or the gorgeously \\nlandscaped gardens around it. The temple was sheer poetry, written in white marble, composed \\nby the architect of the gods. The architect had designed a grand staircase leading up to the main \\ntemple platform, which appeared awe-inspiring, yet inviting. Colossal and ornate marble statues \\nin sober blue and grey had been engraved on the platform. Elaborately carved pillars supported \\nan ostentatious yet tasteful ceiling of blue marble. The architect obviously knew that Lord Ram’s \\nfavourite time of the day was the morning. For on the ceiling, the morning sky, as it would have \\nbeen seen in the absence of the temple roof, had been lovingly painted. On top of the ceiling, the \\ntemple spire shot upwards to a height of almost one hundred metres, like a giant namaste to the \\ngods. The Swadweepans, to their credit, had not forced their garish sensibilities on the temple. Its \\nrestrained beauty was in keeping with the way the sober Lord Ram would have liked it. \\n\\nShiva did not notice any of this. Nor did he look at the intricately carved statues in the inner \\nsanctum. Lord Ram’s idol at the centre was surrounded by his beloveds. To the right was his \\nloving wife, Sita, and to the left was his devoted brother, Lakshman. At their feet, on his knees, \\nwas Lord Ram’s most fervent and favourite disciple, Hanuman, of the Vayuputra tribe, the sons oj \\nthe Wind God. \\n\\nShiva could not find the strength to meet Lord Ram’s eyes. He feared the verdict he would \\nreceive. He crouched behind a pillar, resting against it, grieving. When he couldn’t control his \\nintense feelings of guilt anymore, his eyes released the tears they had been holding back Shiva \\nmade desperate attempts to control his tears, but they kept flowing as though a dam had burst. He \\nbit into his balled fist, overcome by remorse. He curled his legs up against his chest and rested his \\nhead on his knees. \\n\\nDrowning in his sorrow, Shiva did not feel the compassionate hand on his shoulder. Seeing no \\nreaction, the hand squeezed his shoulder lightly. Shiva recognised the touch but kept his head low. \\nHe did not want to appear weak be seen with tears in his eyes. The gentle hand, old and worn \\nwith age, withdrew quietly, while its owner waited patiently until Shiva composed himself. When \\nthe tune was right, he came forward and sat down in front of him. A sombre Shiva did a formal \\nnamaste to the Pandit, who looted almost exactly like the Pandits that Shiva had met at the \\nBrahma temple at Meru and the Mohan temple at Mohan Jo Daro. He sported a similar \\n\\n\\n\\nextensively flowing white beard and a white mane. He wore a saffron dhoti and angvastram, just \\nlike the other pandits. The wizened face had the same calm, welcoming smile. The only \\ndifference was that this Pandit bore a considerably more generous waist. \\n\\n‘Is it really so bad?’asked the Pandit, his eyes narrowed and head tilted slightly, in the typically \\nIndian em pathetic look \\n\\nShiva shut his eyes and lowered his head again. The Pandit waited patiently for Shiva’s reply. \\n‘You don’t know what I have done! ’ \\n\\n‘I do know.’ \\n\\nShiva looked up at the Pandit, his eyes full of surprise and shame. \\n\\n‘I know what you have done, Oh Neelkanth,’said the Pandit. ‘And I ask again, is it really so \\nbad?’ \\n\\n‘Don’t call me the Neelkanth,’ glared Shiva. ‘I don’t deserve the tide. I have the blood of \\nthousands on my hands.’ \\n\\n‘Many more than thousands have died,’said the Pandit. ‘Probably hundreds of thousands. But \\nyou really think they wouldn’t have died if you hadn’t been around? Is the blood really on your \\nhands?’ \\n\\n‘Of course it is! It was my stupidity that led to this war. I had no idea what I was doing. A \\nresponsibility was thrust upon me and I wasn’t worthy of it! Hundreds of thousands have perished \\nas a result! ’ \\n\\nShiva curled up his fist and pounded his forehead, desperately trying to soothe the throbbing \\nheat on his brow. The Pandit stared in mild surprise at the deep red blotch on Shiva’s forehead, \\nright between his eyes. It didn’t bear the colour of a blood clot. It was a much deeper hue, almost \\nblack The Pandit controlled his surprise and remained silent. Now was not the correct time. \\n\\n‘And it’s all because of me,’ moaned Shiva, his eyes moistening again. ‘It’s all my fault.’ \\n\\n‘Soldiers are Kshatriyas, my friend,’ said the Pandit, a picture of calm. ‘Nobody forces them to \\ndie. They choose their path, knowing the risks. And the possible glory that comes with it. The \\nNeelkanth is not the kind of person on whom responsibility can be thrust against his will. You \\nchose this. You were born for it.’ \\n\\nShiva looked at the Pandit starded. His eyes seemed to ask ‘Born for it?’ \\n\\nThe Pandit ignored the question in Shiva’s eyes. ‘Everything happens for a reason. If you are \\ngoing through this turmoil, there is a divine plan behind it.’ \\n\\n‘What bloody divine reason can there be for so many deaths?’ \\n\\n‘The destruction of evil? Wouldn’t you say that is a very important reason?’ \\n\\n‘But I did not destroy evil!’yelled Shiva. ‘These people aren’t evil. They \\'re just different. Being \\ndifferent isn’t evil.’ \\n\\nThe Pandit’s face broke into his typically enigmatic smile. ‘Exactly. They are not evil. They \\nare just different. You have realised it very quickly, my friend, a lot earlier than the previous \\nMahadev.’ \\n\\nShiva was perplexed by the Pandit’s words for an instant. ‘Lord Rudra?’ \\n\\n‘Yes! Lord Rudra.’ \\n\\n‘But he did destroy evil. He destroyed the Asuras.’ \\n\\n‘And, who said the Asuras were evil?’ \\n\\n‘I read it...’ Shiva stopped mid—sentence. He finally understood. \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Yes,’ smiled the Pandit. ‘You have guessed it correctly. Just like the Suryavanshis and the \\nChandravanshis see each other as evil, so did the Devas and the Asuras. So if you are going to \\nread a book written by the Devas, what do you think the Asuras are going to be portrayed as?’ \\n\\n‘You mean they were j ust like today’s Suryavanshis and Chandra vanshis?’ \\n\\n‘More so than you can imagine. The Devas and the Asuras, just like the Chandravanshis and the \\nSuryavanshis, represent two balancing life forces — a duality’ \\n\\n‘Duality?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, a duality that is one of the many perspectives of the universe — the masculine and the \\nfeminine. The Asuras and the Suryavanshis stand for the masculine. The Devas and the \\nChandravanshis speak for the feminine. The names change, but the life forces they embody \\nremain the same. They will always exist. There is no way that either can be destroyed. \\nOtherwise the universe will implode.’ \\n\\n‘And they see their fight with the other as the eternal struggle between good and evil.’ \\n\\n‘Exactly,’beamed the Pandit, marvelling at Shiva’s keen mind even in this time of distress. ‘But \\nthey haven’t been fighting all the time. Sometimes, there have been long periods of cooperation \\nas well. In times of strife, which usually happens when there is evil, it is easiest to blame each \\nother. A difference of opinion between two dissimilar ways of life gets portrayed as a fight \\nbetween good and evil. Just because the Chandravanshis are different from the Suryavanshis \\ndoesn’t mean that they are evil. Why do you think the Neelkanth had to be an outsider?’ \\n\\n‘So that he would not be biased towards any one point of view,’ said Shiva, as a veil lifted \\nbefore his eyes. \\n\\n‘Exactly! The Neelkanth has to be above all this. He has to be devoid of any bias.’ \\n\\n‘But I was not beyond biases. I was convinced that the Chandravanshis are evil. Maybe what \\nAnandmayi says is right. Maybe I am naive, easily misled.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t be so hard on yourself, my friend. You cannot drop from the sly knowing everything, \\ncan you? You would have to enter from any one side. And whichever side you entered the \\nequation from, you would obviously be coloured by their viewpoint, seeing the other side as evil. \\nYou realized your error early. Lord Rudra did not recognise it till it was almost too late. He had \\nnearly destroyed the Asuras before he grasped the simple fact that they were not evil, just \\ndifferent.’ \\n\\n‘\\'Nearly destroyed them? You mean some Asuras still exist?’ \\n\\nThe Pandit smiled mysteriously. ‘That conversation is for another time my friend. The point \\nyou need to understand is that you are not the first Mahadev who was misled. And you will not be \\nthe last. Imagine, if you will, what Lord Rudra’s feelings of guilt must have been?’ \\n\\nShiva kept quiet, his eyes downcast. The knowledge of Lord Rudra’s guilt did not reduce the \\nshame that racked his soul. Reading his thoughts, the Pandit continued. ‘You took the best decision \\nyou could tale under the circumstances. I know this will be cold comfort, but being the Neelkanth \\nisn’t easy. You will have to bear the burden of this guilt. I know the kind of person you are. It will \\nbe a heavy burden. Your challenge is not to ignore the guilt or the pain. You have too good a heart \\nto be able to do that. Your challenge is to stay true to your karma, to your duty, in spite of the \\npain. That is the fate and the duty of a Mahadev.’ \\n\\n‘But what kind of a Mahadev am I? Why am I required? How am I to destroy evil if I don’t \\nknow what evil is?’ \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Who said your job is to destroy evil?’ \\n\\nA startled Shiva glared at the Pandit. He hated the irritating word games that these pandits \\nseemed to love. \\n\\nGlimpsing the anger in Shiva’s eyes, the Pandit clarified immediately. ‘The strength that evil \\nhas is overestimated, my friend. It is not so difficult to annihilate. All it takes is for a few good \\nmen to decide that they will fight it. At practically all the times that evil has raised its head, it has \\nmet the same fate. It has been destroyed.’ \\n\\n‘Then why am I required?’ \\n\\n‘You are required for the most crucial task To answer that most important question.’ \\n\\n‘What?’ \\n\\nWhat is evil?’ \\n\\nWhat is evil?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. Many wars have been fought between men,’said the Pandit. ‘And many more will be \\nfought in the future. That is the way of the world. But it is only a Mahadev who converts one of \\nthose wars into a battle between good and evil. It is only the Mahadev who can recognise evil and \\nlead men against it. Before evil raises its ugly head and extinguishes all life.’ \\n\\n‘But how do I recognise evil?’ \\n\\n‘I can’t help you there my friend. I am not the Mahadev. This is a question you must find the \\nanswer to. But you have the heart. You have the mind. Keep them open and evil will appear \\nbefore you.’ \\n\\n‘Appear? ’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’explained the Pandit. ‘Evil has a relationship with you. It will come to you. You have to \\nkeep your mind and your heart open so that you recognise it when it appears. I have only one \\nsuggestion. Don’t be hasty in trying to recognise evil. Wait for it. It will come to you.’ \\n\\nShiva frowned. He looted down, trying to absorb the strange conversation. He turned towards \\nLord Ram’s idol, seeking some direction. He did not find the judgemental eyes he expected to \\nsee. Instead, he saw a warm, encouraging smile. \\n\\n‘Your journey is not over, my friend. Not by a long shot. It has just begun. You have to keep \\nwalking. Otherwise evil will triumph.’ \\n\\nShiva’s eyes dried up a bit. His burden didn’t feel any lighter, but he felt strong enough to carry \\nit. He had to keep walking to the very end. \\n\\nShiva looted up at the Pandit and smiled weakly. ‘Who are you?’ \\n\\nThe Pandit smiled. ‘I know the answer had been promised to you. And a vow by any of us is a \\ncollective vow. I will not break it.’ \\n\\nShiva gazed at the Pandit, waiting for the answer. \\n\\n‘We are the Vasudevs.’ \\n\\n‘The Vasudevs?’ \\n\\n‘Yes. Each Vishnu leaves a tribe behind entrusted with two missions.’ \\n\\nShiva continued to watch the Pandit intently. \\n\\n‘The first mission is to help the next Mahadev, if and when he comes.’ \\n\\n‘And the second?’ \\n\\n‘The second is that one of us will become the next Vishnu, whenever we are required to do so. \\nThe seventh Vishnu, Lord Ram, entrusted this task to his trusted lieutenant, Lord Vasudev. We are \\n\\n\\n\\nhis followers. We are the tribe of Vasudev.’ \\n\\nShiva stared at the Pandit, absorbing the implications of this information. He frowned as one \\ninference suddenly occurred to him. ‘Did the Mahadevs also leave some tribes behind? Did Lord \\nRudra?’ \\n\\nThe Pandit smiled, deeply impressed by Shiva’s intellect. The Mohan Jo Daro Secretary was \\ncorrect. This man is capable of being a Mahadev. \\n\\n‘Yes. Lord Rudra did leave behind a tribe. The tribe of Vayuputra.’ \\n\\n‘Vayuputra?’ asked Shiva. The name sounded oddly familiar. \\n\\nThe Pandit placed his hand on Shiva’s shoulder. ‘Leave this for another time, my friend. I think \\nwe have spoken enough for today. Go home. You need your good wife’s comforting embrace. \\nTomorrow is another day. And your mission can wait till then. For now, go home.’ \\n\\nShiva smiled. An enigmatic smile. Out of character with his simple Tibetan ways. But he had \\nbecome an Indian now. He leaned forward to touch the Pandit’s feet. The Pandit placed his hand \\non his head to bless him, speaking gently, ‘Vijayibhav. Jai Guru Vishwamitra. Jai Guru \\nVashishta.’ \\n\\nShiva nodded, accepting the blessings with grace. He got up, turned and waited towards the \\ntemple steps. At the edge of the platform, he turned around to look at the Pandit once again. The \\nPandit sat on his haunches, touching his head reverentially to the ground that Shiva had just \\nvacated. Shiva smiled and shook his head slightly. Looking beyond the Pandit, he gazed intently at \\nthe idol of Lord Ram. He put his hands together in a namaste and paid his respects to the Lord. \\n\\nHis burden didn’t feel any tighter. But he felt strong enough to carry it. \\n\\nHe turned and started climbing down. At the bottom, he was surprised to find Sati leaning \\nagainst the statue of an apsara in the middle of the compound. He smiled. There was nobody in \\nthe world whom he would rather see at this time. \\n\\nWalking towards her, he teased, ‘Are you always going to follow me around?’ \\n\\n‘I know when you need to be alone,’ smiled Sati. ‘And when you need me.’ \\n\\nShiva froze suddenly. He could see a robe flapping behind the trees, a short distance from Sati. \\nThe light evening breeze gave away the position of the skulking man. Sati followed Shiva’s gaze \\nand turned around. A robed figure, wearing a Holi mask, emerged from behind the trees. \\n\\nIt is him! \\n\\nShiva’s heart started beating faster. He was still a considerable distance away from Sati. The \\nNaga was too close for comfort. The three stood rooted to their spots, assessing the situation, \\nevaluating the others next move. It was Sati who moved first. Shifting quickly, she pulled a knife \\nfrom her side-hold and flung it at the Naga. The Naga barely stirred. The knife missed him \\nnarrowly, slamming hard into the tree behind him, burying deep into the wood. \\n\\nShiva moved his hand slowly towards his sword. \\n\\nThe Naga reached behind, pulled the knife out of the tree and in a strange act, tied it tightly to \\nhis right wrist with a cloth band. Then he moved, quickly. \\n\\n‘Sati!’screamed Shiva, as he drew his sword and started sprinting towards his wife, pulling his \\nshield forward as he ran. \\n\\n...to be continued \\n\\n'"
